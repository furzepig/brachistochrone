It splashed and spat from walls and rooftops. It swept in stinging rooster tails from the wheels of surging carriages. It fell like the waters of a force from the broken eaves. The soot and filth of the city seethed in grimy streams: slicking the pavements, &nbsp;scouring the gutters, pooling in street-spanning lakes, choking the narrow drains and drawing forth foul effluent from those shameful, forgotten rivers lying long buried beneath the cobbles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span>He </span><span class="c0">walked through the rain and did not step over the streams that crossed his path. He did not hurry from doorway to doorway seeking shelter. He was a thinking man and had reasoned long since that he could get no wetter. The rain coursed down his lank hair and into his sleep-starved eyes. A grimy Neptune&#39;s beard fell from his unshaven chin as he set his face against the downpour. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">The city was drowning him. The smell of it rose from the deluged streets and into the steamy air. It was a smell of horses and smoke, of sewage and sodden wool, of the thin gunpowder wistfulness of wet stone and the fat flatulence of rotting vegetables. The noise of it surged around him like an angry sea </span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;costermongers&#39; cries and thundering carriages and the vicious</span><span>&nbsp;rasp of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the rain on the cobbles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the maddening sight of it made no impression upon him. Instead, he looked through the tumbling city as if staring at something which lay at a great distance and from which he could not turn his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He made his way in some fashion that he could not name, navigating the unfamiliar streets until at last he found himself at the foot of broad stone steps that led to a green door. The door was as wide as he was tall. He raised his head to better gauge the splendour of the great house to which it was the entrance and supposed that it must have been the chill of the water that ran from his hat and down his back at that moment that caused him to shiver.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">Get yourself along there! Your sort aren&#39;t welcome here.</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A periwigged footman in braided livery stood in the open doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man in the red coat stared at something that lay somewhere far beyond the footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">Didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">t you hear me? No beggars here!</span><span>&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man in the red coat was silent for a long time, and then he said &#39;I am Alex Coldstream. I am expected.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The footman&#39;s face twitched and he made half a bow as he stood to one side in the doorway. Alex climbed the wide stone stairs and took the water-logged hat from his head as he passed under the shelter of a grand portico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">Beg pardon sir. It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">s the coat see. We get so many of </span><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">em.</span><span>&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex looked at the footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;If you take my meaning sir,&#39; said the footman with a nod and a chummy smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You mean you thought that I had offered my life in service to my country? You are wrong. I have not had that honour.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a pause. The footman looked at Alex. Alex looked at the footman. He became aware that he was the cause of quite a large puddle that had formed on the top step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Shall I take your coat sir?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex lurched backwards from the proferred hand causing the footman to start, and then with more composure he said, &#39;I will keep my coat.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;As you will, sir. Do come in. There is a fire in the drawing room. I shall fetch the admiral and the maid shall fetch towels. Perhaps your hat sir?&#39; enquired the footman carefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stared as if the man were speaking in a foreign language. Then he took the tattered tricorn from his head, slick with rain and the filth of the road and handed it to the powdered footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Thank you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The footman made a stilted bow and carried the hat away at arm&#39;s length.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex found himself alone in a huge hallway with a floor made of marble tiles in a black and white pattern like a chess board. He made a knight&#39;s move, two squares forward and one to the right. He looked at the door of the drawing room that the footman had indicated and considered the squares that lay between him and the doorway. He turned to his left and made another knight&#39;s move - two squares forward and one to the left - then another which brought him up against a huge cabinet and then another that brought him to the door of the drawing room and would have taken him through it if the pattern had continued within, but it did not. He was pleased with himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex dripped. He walked across the polished wooden boards of the drawing room leaving a trail of small puddles. He was a stranger to rooms such as this. It was furnished with well-stuffed sophas and chaise-longues arranged about a grand marble fireplace that held a grate on which glowed a tidy and well-established fire of coals. The walls were filled with vast dark paintings and mirrors in baroque frames and the air was thick with the sweet smell of beeswax. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Something drew him in across an elaborate rug of extravagant dimension on which he left dark footprints. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A sound. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A skipping tick that seemed to Alex as familiar as his own heartbeat. On the mantle shelf stood a clock. It was ornate and club footed and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">looked very heavy. It was gilt and ivory and ormolu. Alex stood before the clock, feeling the heat of the fire on his legs less than the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">radiant brassy light that was reflected from the clock face. He reached up and touched it - traced the name engraved there beneath the winding holes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whirlaway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no need to look round. The wall behind the clock contained a mirror in which he could see the whole room and the door to the hallway through which he had just passed. He pulled on a loop of string that was fastened around his neck, drawing a small brass winding key with odd ridges along its blunt snout from beneath the sodden linen of his shirt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He placed the hollow end of the key into the right hand winding hole and turned it one full turn anticlockwise. The clock clunked. Alex took the key out and fitted it into the left hand winding hole and turned it one full turn clockwise. The face of the clock swung out</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">towards him, bringing a dense mechanism of clockwork with it, spinning and ticking. He smiled, admiring the elegance of the piece. It was</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">an early work, almost exuberant in its youthful vitality, but still perfect in every way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Every way except one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were always in different places, carefully concealed from even the trained eye of a skilled clockmaker, but now that he had undone</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the hidden locking mechanism this one was obvious. A skinny, twitching balance wheel that protruded ever so slightly from the rest of the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">mechanism. He glanced up at the mirror and found himself to be alone still in the room. He took a deep breath and held it. Then, with the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">utmost care he laid the tip of a grimy finger on the curved blades of the tiny teeth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The wheel stopped. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The clock ticked onwards without skipping a beat. Alex pushed down on the wheel, felt it give a little, then there was the tripping of a catch somewhere unseen and the wheel popped up out of the mechanism as if presenting itself. He drew it forth between finger and thumb.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no time to study his prize. He slipped the cog wheel into the doubled over cuff of his red coat, shut the face of the clock</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">again, withdrew the key and watched. The ticking of the mechanism stopped and then the hands of the clock began to move in a strange</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">glide that was quite unlike their normal motion. The hour hand moved anti-clockwise. The minute hand moved clockwise. After a full sweep of the hours, the hands came to rest at a quarter past two, and then moved again, this time reversing their directions. Four times they</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">passed across the face of the clock, each time stopping at a different place. After the fourth stoppage the hands swept onwards, both moving clockwise this time, until they showed the true hour, and the clock began to tick again, as if nothing had occurred. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He turned to find the footman standing in the doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Admiral Turvey is here, sir,&#39; said the footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex studied the man&#39;s face, but could not tell whether or not he had been discovered. He was adept at reading the faces of clocks, but the faces of men seemed always blank to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A rhythmic creaking sound came from behind the footman, as if the spars of an ancient ship were groaning in a heavy swell in the hallway and Alex watched as the weathered hulk of the admiral hove into view, spilling the footman into the room like a porpoise on his bow wave. &nbsp;Turvey towered in the doorway - a crag of dark rock looming out of a storm sea. Long grey hair fell to the broad shoulders of a navy blue coat that concealed a bulging waistcoat embroidered with golden thread. His legs were curiously lithe for such a man mountain and it seemed to Alex that without the support of a gnarled staff of silvered driftwood they would have been in danger of snapping beneath his great weight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The admiral grunted and pointed at Alex with a sweep of his stick and to Alex&#39;s astonishment his child like legs creaked and groaned beneath him as he did so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Coldstream is it? Tall fellow. Bean pole. Doesn&#39;t forget things. Whirlaway&#39;s boy.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex nodded. It was an accurate description.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You are half-drowned, sir. Were you wrecked upon my doorstep or did you swim here?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I have walked here sir. These last two days from Cambridge. &nbsp;I had no money to take the stage any further.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Admiral Turvey looked Alex up and down as if appraising him in a new light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Walked is it? Well, take advantage of your legs while you have them, Coldstream. That is my advice. I used the legs that God gave to me to feed the gulls at Trafalgar.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex tried hard not to stare as the admiral entered the room, swaying and creaking as he did so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Your master built me these legs. Before he blew himself up that is.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He did not.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I assure you that he did, sir!&#39; thundered the admiral. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I was present at several most undignified fittings before he succeeded in progressing the blasted things to their present form.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A maid arrived in the doorway, carrying a bale of dry towels. She stopped as she saw the quivering red jowls of the furious admiral.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Forgive me sir. I meant to say only that he did not blow himself up.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;This cold winter has kept us warm, Mr Coldstream, safe by our firesides, no sense in venturing across the channel out of campaigning season, eh? But winter is ended, Mr Coldstream. Winter is ended and we are not yet saved.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Where did you serve?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I am not a fighting man, sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Admiral pushed his face towards Alex, the distance between the tips of their noses, no wider than a fingertip. Alex could smell rum and the moulder of old age. &#39;The devil you aren&#39;t, sir. A man doesn&#39;t have eyes like that without being on a battlefield and most men with such eyes have the decency to leave them closed beneath the mud thereof.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I am not a soldier. I have never been in a battle. Not one with a name.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Admiral scowled and turned away, lurching towards a great oak sideboard that occupied most of one of the room&#39;s long walls, his legs creaking and twanging as he went.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It seems to me that you have entirely too much history Mr Coldstream. It is unseemly in one so young, and ungracious in a man of your class.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It seems he was one of your lot.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Admiral Turvey met Alex&#39;s hawkish gaze and drank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Forgive me, sir. I do not understand you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A mathematickal Johnny. Good with figures. Artilleryman they say.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah yes. The famous memory. I am told that you do not forget anything. Is that so?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It&#39;s true I have a keen memory for numbers, sir. And dates.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Admiral drained his glass and poured himself another without looking away from Alex for an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex was not good at people. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is not quite right that a man should remember everything. &nbsp;Still, it may prove useful.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You are a Banksian then sir? &nbsp;Do you believe that chance alone separates men from the beasts? &nbsp;That we may be perfected by the role of a dice?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed no.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I am glad to hear it!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That is, I do not believe we may be perfected. &nbsp;It is certain that there is much chance involved in our make up.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turvey shook his head, though whether in disgust or dismay Alex could not fathom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not like you, Mr Coldstream. &nbsp;Not at all. &nbsp;We are men of different centuries you and I, and I find it vexing that the world must pass into the hands of men like you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turvey drained another glass and immediately refilled it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Nevertheless, it seems it must. &nbsp;Those qualities in you that I dislike, nay despise, are the very ones that are sought,&#39; Turvey drank once more, but this time slowly and thoughtfully, &#39;Admiral Collingwood asked me to find him an engineer.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I assure you there are many better qualified than I who</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">answer to that title. If it is indeed Admiral Collingwood who asks,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">then why does he not ask Stevenson?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Admiral Turvey turned towards him with a thoughtful look on his face</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and then smiled a glistening, gap-filled smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Admiral Collingwood keeps his own counsel on these matters.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He would say only that he required a young engineer, preferably one</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">who spoke French and certainly one who wasn&#39;t a dreamer.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I dream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Really? Well, I am sorry to hear of it Mr Coldstream, very sorry indeed.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I dream that I will find those who murdered my master.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh well, that&#39;s alright then. The Admiral&#39;s precise words</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">were \emph{no fantasies of clockwork castles. A certain healthy desire for</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">vengeance shouldn&#39;t be any obstacle to your taking the position. The</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">admiral is not above that sort of thing himself you know.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the first time, Alex&#39;s eyes seemed to focus on something nearer to him than the far distant horizon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Forgive me sir. What exactly did you say the position was?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I didn&#39;t Mr Coldstream. It does not have a title as such. You might think of it as helping the Admiral with matters of an engineering nature. It seems that warfare is being brought into the nineteenth century. These steam contrivances we hear so much of have piqued the interest of certain of our admirals and generals. Cuthbert himself is no enthusiast you understand, but he does like to keep abreast of such things.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He wishes are to use engines in warfare? But how, this is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">madness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Every year Whirlaway himself would come and clean the blasted</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">thing. Regular as clockwork, eh? A true craftsman, sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You could spend the rest of your days cleaning Billy Whirlaway&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">clocks for him, or you could do something of use to your king and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">your country. Believe me, Mr Coldstream, you are not the only one</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">who would like to know exactly what happened to Whirlaway.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And exactly what is it that you wish me to do?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The admiral turned with two well aimed plantings of his stick and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">with much creaking and twanging from his legs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And get yourself cleaned up man.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Trust Collingwood. Ask him.&#39; That was the message that the clock had given to him and now it </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">because the thing that mattered most to him in the world was getting into the admiralty and because, until this night, of all the people in the world who might have had his master killed, it seemed to him that Admiral Collingwood was the most likely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Governess ## {#the_governess}</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The trap was William&#39;s work. She knew that whilst it could have been either of the twins who had taken the leather whipcord from the toy whip and top and tied it at ankle height between the newel posts at the foot of the final gloomy flight of stairs that led to her room -- where it was made quite invisible by the shadows thrown from the guttering candle stub by which she made her way -- it could only have been William who had arranged a company of ten Prussian infantry standing smartly to attention, with rifles shouldered and bayonets fixed, four steps up at the place where her face would have struck had she been careless enough not to check for such hazards. She untied the whip and coiled the cord into a neat loop, then carried the toy soldiers from the step and placed them carefully on the high sill of the narrow window that looked on to the little landing, ready for her to return them to the nursery in the morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She allowed herself a brief smile as she climbed the last few stairs to her narrow room. William had become complacent in recent weeks. The creativity she had come to expect from him was fading. She knew that it was because she was no longer a meaningful victim. &nbsp;His mind was elsewhere now, expanding beyond the childish space of the nursery and into the new world of school where he and George were to be sent in just eleven long days time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was looking forward to it immensely. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And one week on Saturday he would be gone, cast into a huge pool of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">even bigger and more vicious bullies than he.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was looking forward to it immensely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was one thing to be said for being a governess it was a respectable</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">profession. That this was the only thing to be said for it had quickly</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">become apparent to Isobel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;William, point the pistol at the floor and then place it</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">gently on the rug.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Do not be dramatic Miss Prentiss,&#39; said Lady Marchpane,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is not a real pistol.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I assure you it is.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And where would the child have got a real pistol from?&#39; said Lady Marchpane with a snort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I believe that he stole it from my room.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Miss Prentiss, your work here has been unsatisfactory from</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the first, but it is difficult for me to believe that even you would leave</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">such an item as a pistol lying around for the boys to play with.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It was not lying around Lady Marchpane. It was locked in my room. &nbsp;William, however much you may enjoy hurting others, I do not think you are quite ready to kill. &nbsp;Put the pistol down on the rug.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Surely, you are not now suggesting that William has loaded the pistol!&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No, Lady Marchpane.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well then, there is no need for this to continue. William, hand me that awful thing this minute.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">William swung the pistol round towards his mother as she advanced</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">on him. His face a mask of horrified delight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Stop! William has not loaded the pistol, Lady Marchpane,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">but nevertheless I assure you that it is loaded.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And how could you know such a thing?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Because I loaded it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lady Marchpane stopped halfway between William and Isobel and turned to look at the governess with a look of blank incomprehension on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You loaded it? You? You have been keeping a loaded pistol in your room?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Isobel did not hear the shot. Instead there was a sudden transition</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">from Lady Marchpane&#39;s high-pitched incredulity, to a muffled far off whistling, the surge of adrenaline in her blood, the stinging sulphur smell filling her nostrils and, through the curling wisps of powder fog the sight of a saucer sized hole in the green wallpaper made ragged with shattered laths and plaster and horse hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Miss Prentiss, you will leave this house immediately.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## Whirlaway</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex had foregone sleep many times in his life, but rarely had he</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">foregone quite so much sleep and then been presented with quite such</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a comfortable environment in which to remedy the omission. The bed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">was a gigantic square of white which had been stuffed and then stuffed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">again with the softest down, and Alex felt all of the weight of his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">days on the road crashing upon him as he stumbled towards it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a long time he slept without dreaming. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unheard, the clocks and bells of London muttered amongst themselves in the dank night. The</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">rain, as if sleeping now itself after its former vigour fell softly against his window. But something woke within him at last, while his body slumbered on, and he found himself a child again in the workshop of the man who was to be his master. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whirlaway studied his face for a good while. It suddenly occurred to Alex that the workshop was silent, a fact that he found strange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Hold out your hands boy.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex held out his hands and Whirlaway inspected them, not in the cursory</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">way of Mr Prender, checking for dirty nails and ink spots, but carefully,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">finger by finger, pushing back and forth to the full extent of his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">reach and working each joint . When he had finished he looked up at</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex again with his strange eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Something is troubling you. Now what could it be? Let&#39;s see &#39;Alex felt Whirlaway&#39;s gaze pass right through him as if looking for the key to Alex&#39;s soul somewhere in the space behind his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah. The clocks. You are wondering why the room is full of clocks and yet silent?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well, then, the answer is simple. It has been my good fortune to learn that sight is the least of the senses required by a clockman. &nbsp;Indeed one might almost say that being able to see the workings of a clock is a grave impediment.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex looked, and looked again, and it was only then that he realised that the old man was blind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Come then. They say you have a capacity for memory. Show me.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whirlaway turned and strode to his workbench, then sat at one of the two stools that stood there. There was no uncertainty in his movements, rather it was Alex who made his way to the bench with hesitant steps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You are surprised to find that I am blind. Well, I too have memory. I remember where I left the stool standing. How many paces away the bench is. What the day sounds like when there is a fog. That is how I manage to make my way in the world. Now, sit down boy and watch.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A clock stood on the bench. It was an ordinary looking thing. &nbsp;The mechanism was only a set of large wheels with clean lines and widely spaced teeth. Even to Alex&#39;s untrained eyes it seemed almost crude in its</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">simplicity, and yet beneath the grossness of its outer form, Alex</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">knew that he was looking at an item of quality. There was no decoration</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to it, no filigree or inlay, and yet each piece had been exquisitely</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">well made. There was no flashing, not a rough edge, or a scratch or a marks. Everything was smooth and clean and finished. Whirlaway reached forward with a winding key and put a half turn on the spring.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The clock sprang to life. &#39;The mechanism functions as you</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">see. Now. Pay attention.&#39; Whirlaway drew the clock towards</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">himself and let the tension out of the spring. Then he began to take</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the clock to pieces. He worked steadily, laying each piece out on</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a roll of dark blue baise that covered the end of the workbench where</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex sat. From time to time he reached forward and took a tool from</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the rack that was fastened to the wall behind the back edge of the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">bench, each time returning it with a flourish which, Alex supposed, was for his benefit. Because there were no clocks in the room that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">were running, and because Alex found himself in that state of intense concentration that came so readily to him and which excluded the world</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">beyond the clock maker&#39;s bench completely, he could not say how much time had passed when Whirlaway separated the final two components</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and laid them carefully upon the cloth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Now then, boy. Can you put it together again?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex nodded, then realised how foolish this gesture was in front of a blind man and he began to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I heard you, boy,&#39; said Whirlaway, &#39;just get on with it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex began and immediately felt nervous. He was confident that he</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">could remember the sequence in which the pieces had been disassembled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He could see each part and sub-assembly clearly in his mind&#39;s eye,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">but the feel of clockwork beneath his fingers was quite new to him</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and he realised that the ease with which Whirlaway had seemed to work</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">had misled him. Alex moved slowly, trying to replicate the patterns</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that he remembered as carefully as he could. Whirlaway sat, with his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">head resting forward, thumb and finger pinching at the bridge of his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">nose. His eyes were closed. Several times he gave an affirmative grunt</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as Alex completed a difficult assembly and once a derisive snort,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as Alex tried to use too much force on a spindle already half-loaded</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">with cog wheels that came apart in his hands and had to be begun again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite his concentration, Alex was painfully aware of the passage of time as he worked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Is there light enough?&#39; Whirlaway asked as dusk began to fall outside. Alex nodded and worked on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When at last he thought himself finished, he stood the clock carefully before Whirlaway, and became suddenly aware of a great tiredness that filled his whole being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whirlaway sat up and reached forward with his winding key, fitting it smoothly into the mechanism and giving it a half turn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The proof of the pudding then Mr Coldstream,&#39; he said and withdrew the key.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The clock sprang into life once more, ticking and whirring, just as it had before, or so it seemed to Alex. Whirlaway sat and listened</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">with his eyes closed, nodding gently to himself, tipping his head first to one side and then the other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A noble effort Mr Coldstream. It is not perfect, not by any means, but we may make a clock man of you yet. Listen. Tell me</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">what you can hear.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ticking.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex listened harder. There was a loud ticking, perhaps once every half a second. Behind that there was a softer, faster ticking at a rate that Alex could not guess at, and behind that the tiniest of gentle clicks that syncopated with the first sound. Alex described all of these sounds to his new master. Whirlaway nodded. &#39;Listen again. Deeper. Those are the sounds you expect to hear. Close your eyes and listen.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex closed his eyes and visited each of the known sounds in turn memorising it completely and trying his best to exclude it from the greater sound. Then he heard it. A faint buzzing that grew in volume within the space of two of the loudest ticks before becoming almost</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">inaudible again. It was as if the tiniest of flies had been trapped inside of the clock and was thrashing back and forth between the walls of the case, stopping for breath each time it struck a wall. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He described the insect to Whirlaway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There is no fly trapped in the case boy, but there is a wheel that is not sitting truly upon its spindle. Now, begin again.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He slept for a long time without dreaming. Then he slept for a long time and dreamt of the trial.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What is he saying Alex?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Watt was screaming in his ear, but Alex could hardly hear him over the roar of the engine. He looked again towards where the other machine was matching them almost stroke for stroke, now slipping back, now surging forward. He felt the sharp pricking of sparks against his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">cheek as Dougal bent again to the work of feeding the ravenous firebox</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and he turned his head towards where Monsieur Montparnasse stood,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">grasping the gleaming levers of his monstrous creation in two clenched</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fists and screaming at them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It&#39;s French, sir!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Aye, lad, I&#39;m not stupid.

He flung the bottle from him with a great sweep of his arm. The bottle struck the cushioned seat of the chaise long, bounced, and then fell to the floor where the two men watched it as it rolled to a gentle stop before the fireplace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;See!

And Alex, following along behind, the good listener with only half his mind tipped in Percy&#39;s direction and the rest lost in some cool world of white shadows tinkering with equations and vast machineries of imaginary clockwork.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Poetry is dead, Alex.

Alex saw Percy&#39;s jeering face draw downwards into a mask of horror as he stared at the small green volume held in the quivering hands of Mr Trace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh God, no. Please God, anything but that awful doggerel.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex was about to remind Poynter of his avowed atheism but Mr Trace had begun the recitation:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Bent double, like old men under sacks ....&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Haven&#39;t they had enough of it?&#39; seethed Percy, blinking through red eyes that were filling with drunken tears of rage and self pity. But Alex noted that he spoke quietly and that the background hubbub of the inn had ebbed away as the familiar words rang out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;As if a current under a dream sea had picked his bones in whispers. &nbsp;If you could walk beside me then, behind the cart where we threw him</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was applause then, and some booing. A small scuffle in the corner was quickly brought to an end by a burly pot man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Dying, Alex. It&#39;s the only way to live forever. And dying in prison, moreover dying because you&#39;re in prison because of your art - that&#39;s the bloody genius of the man.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Hello who is this?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Who is who?&#39; But Alex had already followed the poet&#39;s gaze and found himself entranced by the sight of the woman standing in the tavern doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I think know that woman.&#39; he murmured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Come now Coldstream, if you really knew that woman you would more than think it.&#39; said Percy draining the remaining half tankard of beer in a single gulp and wiping his mouth with a greasy sleeve without once taking his eyes from her, &#39;I should say that I should like to know her though.

Isobel had never considered</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">herself to be a lady, and in her experience respectability was only</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a matter of opinion. The tavern had another name painted on its sign,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">but she knew it for what it really was, The Gilded Shell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was her father who had taught her to shoot, but her mother who had taught her to drink.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of the two skills, it was drinking that she was called upon to use more frequently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man was gaunt. Isobel knew that he was hungry. Food was expensive in England, a scarce commodity that was valued by those who could afford it and fiercely coveted by those who could not. She knew how desperate hungry men could be, and yet she knew also that she was not hungry, that despite the other privations of her post she had been fed, if not well, then adequately. &nbsp;She knew that she was stronger than the man, and faster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Spare a penny for an old soldier, miss?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He came shambling towards her with his hand outstretched, but he was</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">moving too fast, approaching too directly, his true intent revealed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had no thought of stopping to receive alms, he had committed himself to taking everything that she had. She drew the pistol from beneath her shawl. For a moment his advance faltered and his face fell into a look of doubt. Then he stopped and leered at her, a broken smile of yellowed teeth and their black absence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You stupid bitch, you&#39;re holding it at the wrong end. I know things like that see, I used to be a soldier.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew that he would choose that moment to strike and as he lunged clumsily towards her, she took a single step to her left and swung</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the pistol hard towards him in a smooth arc. The heavy wooden butt of the weapon struck him above the left temple where his lank hair</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">was plastered by the rain. He fell to the street as if he had been dropped there from a height. Isobel put the pistol away again beneath</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">her shawl and pushed gently at the man&#39;s head with the toe of her boot so that she could see his face. Blood was streaming from his head and mixing with rivulets of soft rain. It slicked across the greasy cobbles. It seemed to her that the blood was somehow darker even than the night street because it carried colour into a place where there was none. The man was still breathing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It \emph{is you!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I&#39;m afraid you are mistaken sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No, you are Elodie.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A look of such anguish crossed her face that Alex felt as if he had</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">been struck a blow on his chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You are mistaken sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She raised the hood of her cloak and turned away, disappearing into</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the night and the rain, leaving Alex feeling as blasted and empty</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as a forgotten battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Hurry up please, it&#39;s time!

Her name is Elodie.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And yet she said otherwise.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;We must follow her.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Don&#39;t be a damn fool, it&#39;s raining and I&#39;m hungry, moreover</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">people have been reciting poetry at me!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Come on.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex ducked through the low doorway out into the cool spring night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rain fell softly, deadening the sounds of the street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Which way did she go? Did you see?&#39; Alex demanded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That way. Past the undertakers,&#39; said a reluctant</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Poynter as he wound the pythonic length of scarf about his neck and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">shoulders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex set off at a trot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What if it is her?&#39; said Percy hurrying to keep up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I mean, so what if it is her. She either doesn&#39;t recognise</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you, or doesn&#39;t want to speak to you, what does it matter. Who is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">she anyway?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;She is -- I am not sure I remember quite rightly who she is.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I thought you never forgot anything.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No. I only remember those things that I have understood.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Aha! So you could in fact be mistaken about her.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I am not.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There&#39;s the Alex I know, riven by doubt.&#39; Poynter</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fished a crust of pastry from the pocket of his overcoat,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">studied it for a moment and then discarded it into the gutter. &#39;Elodie</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is a French name.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And that would make her French then? Or at least a tadpole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Born to frogs.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stopped dead, looked about himself as if bewildered and then</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ducked into a narrower street to his right, tugging Poynter with him</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">by his scarf.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The latter. She was orphaned by the war.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well that makes her almost unique amongst \emph{les enfants, then doesn&#39;t it? No wonder you have such an interest in her. For God&#39;s sake man, slow down! HMS Poynter is carrying a large cargo of ale and in danger of springing a leak. In fact &shy;--&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex cursed beneath his breath as Poynter stopped and began to relieve himself with his forehead propped against the grimy brick of an alley wall. Steam twisted about his boots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;So she had people in England then? One of the quality is she?&#39; he called over his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There were no people. Just a person.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex felt his anger growing, quite certain that Poynter was in the process of eliminating a far greater volume of liquid than he had imbibed, &#39;You are like a camel, man. God&#39;s hell, where is it all coming from?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Every man must have his talents, Alex. This is mine.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Do you mean in addition to being the greatest poet of the age?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The endless spattering began to falter, &#39;So who was this person?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Who?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You said no people, just a person.&#39; There was silence at last from the foaming gutter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Killarnock.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh I see. Another of his lordship&#39;s waifs and strays is it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Alex, damn your eyes, I&#39;m hungry. There&#39;s a marvellous place I know, just around the corner from here. A johnny from the East India Company runs it. Taste of the orient, that sort of thing. Run by Hindoos, exotic spices, just the thing to cheer a man up.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Chutney?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what is chutney?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is a kind of pickle or relish.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex was used to plain fare. On occasion he had indulged in pickled</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">vegetables. Once, in a tavern in Edinburgh, he had been served mustard. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He looked over to where Poynter was blinking ferociously, tears streaming</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">from his red eyes as he panted for breath, &#39;This is the stuff.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is what makes a man feel alive!&#39; he wheezed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah, Mr Boswell!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Boswell?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes sir, that is my name.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;If there was the sound of water only.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The cricket, no relief, sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Now then, tell me more about what happened to poor Billy Whirlaway.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He talks to you through clocks?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I can speak no more of it Percy. I made a promise.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Mr Boswell, it is time for the speciality of the house.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Very good sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mr Boswell disappeared behind the bejewelled curtain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What is the speciality of the house, Percy?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Chicken Boswell. It is like nothing you have ever tasted before.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what is it made from, apart from the obvious?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Obvious? There is nothing obvious about the Chicken Boswell.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed. Do you mean to say that there is, in fact, no chicken in it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Something of that, Alex, something of that. Mr Boswell keeps the true ingredients secret.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I see.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But it matters not what the meat might or might not be. It is the spice that is the thing. Chicken Boswell contains spices</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that are truly exotic. Fabulously rare.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what does it taste like?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah, Alex, my dear friend. You call me the greatest poet of the age, and yet even I cannot find words to describe it. Perhaps it is as if your tongue was taken from your head and embarked upon a great adventure across all the world, that it tasted calico from a sail darkened with powder and beech smoke at Trafalgar, that it swam in great vats of rubbing alcohol infused with saffron, that it crept one painful half inch at a time through the roiling slag and char of a pig iron smelter, that it rolled with glee in honey and took langorous baths in sloe gin, that it picked its way across holly and hawthorns and clothed itself in the fat of a great sea Leviathan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But only perhaps. I find a little salt sometimes helps to lift it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex prodded at the yellow skin of the dish. &nbsp;Something dark with streaks of purple in it rolled lazily to the viscous surface and then sank again. &nbsp;Alex plunged his fork after it and withdrew a shapeless form that was smeared in the sauce that seemed now to Alex to be somehow faintly luminous. &nbsp;The inside of his nose began to tingle as steam from the thing on his fork rose towards him. &nbsp;That part of his brain that was stubbornly logical and which usually had the last word in situations of indecision began to remind him that he had already made the decision to eat the Chicken Boswell and that further delay was pointless. &nbsp;Alex put the fork in his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Time stopped ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A thought occurred to him that he was well pleased with. He realised, as if for the first time, what a wonder it was that he was precisely the right size and shape to fit into his own skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">... and began again</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">\emph{But we&#39;ll have to do it next week</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cos the Duke has got the clap!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was standing in the middle of a dark street, the rain hanging in the air around him in a fine drizzle. Percy stood a few paces away, arms outstretched holding an earthenware bottle in one hand and singing to the hidden stars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Percy.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What is it old chum?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What happened?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What happened when?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The speciality of the house. Chicken Boswell. I mean, I remember that I was eating the Chicken Boswell and now I am here.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Back with us old man? Good show! First time is always touch and go.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Percy, no I mean Percy, who is that who is walking beside you?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Poynter stopped for a moment and swayed and looked about him, &#39;It&#39;s you, you bloody idiot.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No, no. I mean I&#39;ve counted. And you know. \emph{Do you know? I&#39;m rather good at counting and when I count there are only you and I together, but when I look ahead,&#39; said Alex gesturing with a grand sweep of his arm, &#39;There&#39;s another one walking beside you. Behind you. Back there in the shadow, I&#39;m positively sure there is another one.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Percy looked Alex up and down seriously for a moment. Then he began to laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Lady Of Situations</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What time is it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Almost three o&#39;clock, sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A dim question began to form itself in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is Thursday, sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The admiral gave instructions that you were to be made ready</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for the admiralty ball sir.

Poll hates to be late to the admiralty.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;&quot;Poll&quot; is Lady Jane Montague, Mr Coldstream. &nbsp;The daughter of Rear Admiral Montague.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His knowledge of how to behave in such situations was limited, but he was dimly aware that it was accepted practice to allow ladies to enter a carriage first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Poll!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma flung herself at Lady Jane Montague, again forcing Alex to lurch backwards or find</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">his face buried in the white satin of her behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Carriages can be such a terrible squeeze don&#39;t you find Mr Coldstream?&#39; said Emma and wriggled in the narrow space that was afforded to her. Alex tried to make more room for her, but</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">found that his only recourse was to try and make himself thinner. &nbsp;Failing at this he found himself forced to consider the subject of women for the first time in many years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh Topsy, do stop fidgeting! You get so giddy when there are sailors promised.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma settled herself at last with a satisfied squirm that left her</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">leaning into Alex and with her thigh pressed tightly to his. Alex</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">who was accomodating the nearby knees of Lady Jane Montague found</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">himself unable to move at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do believe that if Mr Coldstream wasn&#39;t so devilishly thin I would be a good deal more comfortable,&#39; announced Emma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Topsy, if there was any meat on him, there&#39;d be no room for you at all.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two women giggled together and Roger Montague stirred, sat suddenly</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">upright, looked about with wild eyes, took a swig from the bottle</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that he was still holding and slumped back into his corner, once more</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma leaned forward, placing a hand on Alex&#39;s far knee to steady herself</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and flicked out her fan with a conspiratorial air, &#39;Poll, you don&#39;t think Roger will get himself into another duel do you? I do worry about him so.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lady Montague giggled. Alex found himself examining Emma Turvey&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">naked shoulders at very close quarters. The unfamiliar smell of scent</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and powder rose from her. He forced himself to look away from the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">bare flesh and found instead the place at the nape of her neck where</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a curl of hair had come free from its tight fastenings and lay against</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the glowing skin like a question mark or a beckoning finger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Do you duel, Mr Coldstream?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I have never yet been in a position where that has been necessary, Lady Montague.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Never yet?&#39; said Lady Montague, raising one eyebrow so far from its usual mooring that Alex had to struggle to stop himself from staring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That is to say --&#39; Alex began, but found himself</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">cut short as the carriage rattled over a pot hole in the road and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma lost her balance and fell into his lap. The carriage rumbled onwards, rocking and swaying over rough ground and it took several attempts for her to find a suitable handhold on Alex&#39;s leg and right herself once more. She dropped back into her seat, flushed in the face and fanning herself vigorously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I say! &nbsp;I do believe that a little meat might be found on Mr Coldstream after all, Poll!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[Description of the admiralty]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">... an overwhelming, dazzling spectacle of light, colour and movement</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that immediately overwhelmed the capacity of Alex&#39;s mind to process</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">such things and left him staring at the whirling frenzy of it all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;These things can be so terribly dull don&#39;t you find?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I&#39;m afraid I really couldn&#39;t say.

It is quite fashionable this season, and one must keep up with fashion, don&#39;t you think?&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Quite,&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Now, Mr Coldstream, I have just had a terribly good idea,&#39;she flicked her fan and looked around with a conspiratorial air, before</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">drawing very close to him and placing a slender, gloved hand on his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">chest, &#39;perhaps we can be of the greatest service to each</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">other. I will share with you the secrets of surviving a ball as tedious</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as this one. I have had a lot of practice at it I&#39;m afraid.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what shall I do in return?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh!&#39; she clapped her hands in excitement, &#39;Well Mr Coldstream we shall simply have to think of something won&#39;t we?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Have you heard about Collingwood&#39;s column?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The most magnificent in London.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes, and I hear they are to build a statue of him too.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stared in wonder at the sight before him. Sat behind a baise covered card table of the sort at which one might normally have found a game of bezique in progress was an incredibly ancient looking woman, dressed in a strange loose fitting robe of deep emerald green. About her head</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">she wore a length of green silk wound into a kind of turban and fastened at the front with a curious silver brooch in the shape of an eye.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah, now that is Madame Sosostris.&#39; said Emma as she followed Alex&#39;s open mouthed gaze</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Madame Sosostris?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes, the famous clairvoyant. They say she is the wisest woman in all Europe.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;She seems unwell.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They watched as the old woman blew her nose on a huge linen handkerchief which she then handed to a dark-skinned footman who stood in attendance behind her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Apparently she has a terribly wicked pack of cards that can tell the future. They call it the \emph{tarreau. She has been to all of the best salons this season. It&#39;s ever so much fun.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma&#39;s face lit up as if an idea had suddenly occurred to her, &#39;Oh -&shy;-&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not think --&#39; said Alex, but it was far too</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">late, she had already dragged him to the front of the circle of interested</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">onlookers who were politely applauding the latest reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Do him. He&#39;s an \emph{enigma.&#39; Emma announced. Alex felt</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the eyes of the crowd turned on him and he heard muttered snatches of conversations that seemed to suggest that Emma&#39;s appraisal of him was finding popular support. Madam Sosostris</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fixed Alex with a beady glare. She stroked the pack briskly with gnarled</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fingers as if it were some sort of impatient pet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Hmph, zis man stands upon too many paths. Three cards only.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex looked about, bemused. Emma clapped her gloved fingers together</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in excitement, and turned to him with eyes ablaze, &#39;How thrilling</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mr Coldstream, you are a man of mystery in the nether world.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Alex could reply he felt Emma grab him tightly by the arm as</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">she gave a little squeal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ze Tower.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That didn&#39;t seem so bad, Alex reflected, although the card itself showed the tower smitten by lightning, the topmost ramparts tumbling to the earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma gasped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ze Hanged Man.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex realised that quite a large crowd was gathering to watch his cards being read.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Don&#39;t worry,&#39; hissed Emma in a conspiratorial whisper, &#39;it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;re going to hang. It&#39;s all about interpretation.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Doesn&#39;t &nbsp;necessarily ...&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once, when a young boy Alex had seen a display of firework rockets</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to celebrate Cochrane&#39;s successful rocket raid on Boulogne. He remembered</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">how the crowd had gasped and sighed in wonder at each explosion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A similar sound enveloped him now as the third card was dealt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Death.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah, now. Look there.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a deft flick of her eyes and a flash of her fan Emma directed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex&#39;s attention towards a hugely fat man who was pondering a selection</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of canap&eacute;s that were being held for his inspection on a silver tray</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">by an impressively blank-faced footman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That&#39;s Monsieur Ouvrier. He&#39;s a French spy.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex studied the man&#39;s sweat studded brow and ruddy cheeks in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A spy? But what&#39;s he doing here? I mean there&#39;s admirals and generals and all sort of military talk. We must tell someone at once.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma was giggling again, &#39;Really Mr Coldstream, you have</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">quite enlivened this evening for me though I do feel simply awful</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for making such fun of you. Everybody knows that he is a spy. Everybody</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">except you that is. That is what spies are for.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I had thought that spies sought to steal secrets for their</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">governments. To help them in war and so forth,&#39; said Alex,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">determined not to get angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No, you are mistaken. You must be thinking of secret agents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or journalists perhaps? Spies are simply a vessel in which important</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">messages may be sent. A captain may be talking to a lieutenant within</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">earshot of Mr Ouvrier and may let slip that an exercise of his regiment</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is to take place ..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is simply how things work.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But it is preposterous!&#39; fumed Alex.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;General Janvier, one of Russia&#39;s most decorated officers.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[Alex retrieves the last piece of the Whirlaway engine, the instructions</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that accompany it indicate that Collingwood cannot be Whirlaway&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">killer. Alex is confused. ]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah, now that is Lord Bradford.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Bradford?&#39; exclaimed Alex.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Why, Mr Coldstream, you seem positively animated.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The man is a genius.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He invented the Bradford condensing engine.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And who else could have done that?&#39; said Emma with a disapproving glance over her fan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He built a tunnel under the Tyne made entirely from iron that is nearly half a mile long and leaks but a little.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes. But he is not one of the quality. He is one of the low upon whom assurance sits.&#39; said Emma loftily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex looked at her, dumbfounded. She giggled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I am teasing you Mr Coldstream. Two hundred thousand pounds a year is sufficient for any woman to overlook matters of pedigree. Lord Bradford has sufficient quality to gain entrance to any salon in London. Would you like to meet him?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[Alex sees and possibly meets Lord Bradford]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Coldstream, is it? Apprenticed to my dear friend William.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is a tragedy of the first order sir. I will offer you my condolences,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">though I fear they will be of little worth.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I am grateful for them, sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Or of course, we could always see if there&#39;s anything happening</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">behind the curtains.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Curtains?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh yes. Terribly naughty things happen behind the curtains.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s ever so funny.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But --&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Let&#39;s see, shall we?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma led him to where a pair of scarlet curtains as tall as sails</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">stood drawn across the bay of a window. She slipped between the curtain</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and the wall, drawing him with her into the cool dark space that lay</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">behind. To Alex&#39;s immense relief, there was no one else there. The</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">noise of the ball was muffled by the great weight of material that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">hung between it and them. The air was cool and refreshing after the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">stuffy heat of the ballroom. The rain had stopped and Alex looked</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">out through the glass across the city that lay before them, dark but</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">faintly glowing like a coal upon a grate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Shall we sit?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma positioned herself primly on the cushioned window seat, and patted</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the space next to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex sat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He realised that the evening had brought him so far beyond the reach of his experience that he was now in danger of falling off the edge of his new world like a sailor in the days before the Clock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I must thank you for your help this evening, Miss Turvey. &nbsp;I do not think I should have been able to navigate my way without it. I am an engineer. I understand mechanisms. People do not have</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">mechanisms and so I confess that I do not understand them at all.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma giggled, &#39;Oh Mr Coldstream, you are quite wrong. People do have mechanisms. It is true that they may sometimes seem complicated but in my experience the machinery of men is usually very simple.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Really? I do not think that can be true. I think that you &shy;- oh.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You seem a little agitated, Mr Coldstream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Miss Turvey, I do not think that this is quite proper.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;On the contrary Mr Coldstream, it would be quite unforgivable</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of me to let you attend your interview with the Admiral in such a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">distracted condition. Do not concern yourself. It is as I said, the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">mechanism is simple. It is well suited to manual operation.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I rather think - haah.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The back of his head struck the window.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I believe I shall shortly have need of your handkerchief, Mr Coldstream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex looked at her with glazed eyes and patted feebly at the pockets of his coat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Your handkerchief?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Hng.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma made a small tutting noise as if exasperated by a child and then dropped from Alex&#39;s hazy view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was only diligent study of the second Earl of Killarnock&#39;s journals that allowed Alex to understand that what happened next was real and not the product of his fevered mind. He felt as if he were falling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were perfect flashes of clear memory. The trials. Bracken covered</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">hills near his childhood home. Then nothing. His mind quite free of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">any thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Emma reappeared before him. He saw with surprise his own hand holding out his handkerchief to her, realising that in his delirium he must finally have located it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She took it from him and frowned reproachfully before dabbing at the corner of her mouth, &#39;A gentleman should always know where his handkerchief is Mr Coldstream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">..and into the presence of the admiral.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## Admiral Collingwood</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood stood at a great table spread with charts and surrounded by a tight</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">knot of sharp looking men, their faces all animated with some hard</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fought debate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;So this is Whirlaway&#39;s boy is it? Coldstream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If any man there had been ignorant of Alex&#39;s true name and had later</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">been asked to record that name on paper for the sake of posterity</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">based only on Admiral Collingwood&#39;s pronunciation of it, then Alex</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">was certain that future historians would have found it rendered Curledstream.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Admiral&#39;s accent was at once the familiar sound of his home and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">yet still strange to his ears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood moved away from the table with the charts, the knot of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">commodores and captains opening before him as if flotsam on the stately</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">bow wave of a great ship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He stopped and looked Alex up and down, then nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex knew with certainty that there was no artifice in Collingwood&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">manner. It was clear to him that the grey haired man with the craggy</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">face standing not two paces before him was the master of everyone</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in that place and had no need to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A north country boy then. London is no place for men such</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as us Mr Coldstream. Whenever I think how I am to be happy again,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">my thoughts carry me back to Morpeth. Is there rum for Mr Coldstream,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Captain Frost?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The herl wealth of this kingdom is built upon cerl. Cerl</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and the ships that carry it Mr Cerldstream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What Mr Cerldstream, would you place your damned infernal</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fire engines inside my wooden ships?&#39; asked Collingwood with</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">eyes open in mock horror. The little group of officers guffawed politely.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There is ner need. Ner need at all. We have ner shortage</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of men to wind our capstans and raise our anchors I assure you. It</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is officer mettle we lack as I have often said.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh no, something much better than that. The ship itself</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">could be propelled by a steam engine attached to a suitable fitment</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">submerged in the water. A sort of water wheel in reverse perhaps.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It would serve to power the ship when the wind was against it or even</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">if it was entirely lacking. I see no reason why a suitably powerful</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">engine could not replace sails altogether.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood&#39;s mocking look changed to become one of genuine horror</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and his face began to change colour. It suddenly occurred to Alex</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">exactly what kind of a man it was who could rise to become the head</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of the most ruthless and most capable fighting force in the whole</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was an uncomfortable silence. Collingwood laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Mr Coldstream is having a little joke with us gentlemen.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what do you think our friend monsieur Bonaparte is doing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">now Coldstream?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I must confess that I have given it little thought sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Fortunately for you Mr Coldstream there are those of us</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">who must give it a great deal of thought. A great deal of thought</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">indeed. And Bonaparte thinks sir, and he plots and broods. But what</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is he thinking? What thinking? What? That is the question on which</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">we ponder night and day.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed sir. Then you must have a good understanding of his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">schemes.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps,&#39; said Collingwood thoughtfully, &#39;What</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">we can say is that all his thoughts and all his failing energies are</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">directed against this island of ours. Yes sir, he is brooding and,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to our eternal misfortune, he seems to have found a quite moment to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">engage in some breeding.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You are speaking of Lucien&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That whelp? Don&#39;t be ridiculous man! He struggles to conquer</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">his own stammer let alone the rest of Europe. No Mr Coldstream, Bonaparte&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">true heir is Beatrice. A creature of pure evil brought up in a poisonous</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">miasma of hatred and thwarted ambition. She is Napoleon&#39;s heir in</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">every conceivable way.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But she is just a child.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;she is not, Mr Coldstream, she is the very devil incarnate and soon</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to be the greatest misfortune ever to befall our great nation.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Forgive me sir, but I had the great good fortune to meet</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lord Bradford earlier this evening. It seems to me that if you require</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">an opinion on an engineering matter then you could do no better than</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to seek his.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I trusted William Whirlaway and because I trusted him and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he, evidently for reasons of his own that I have yet to fathom, saw</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fit to trust you. It is not to be underestimated in this world of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ours Mr Coldstream. Trust.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A short officer stationed himself at Alex&#39;s right elbow and began</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to speak. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[Official Secrets Act]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Stetson, there&#39;s no need for all of that, just show him</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the blasted things&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The officer called Stetson looked so unhappy then, that for a moment</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex thought he might actually begin to cry. Instead he seemed to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">manage to pull himself together</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What do you make of this then, Mr Coldstream?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood pulled the topmost chart from the table and flung it to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the floor where one corner of it caught light from the fire in the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">grate. A naval officer of a rank that Alex thought might have been</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a lieutenant discretely slid the chart from the fire and began to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">smother the flames with his boot. Alex did not see the flames on the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">map put out entirely though for his whole attention was suddenly focussed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">on the papers that Collingwood had revealed and was now stabbing at</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">angrily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stared. The papers were covered with technical drawings. The</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sheer quality of the workmanship before him left him speechless. He</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">heard sniggering from the group of officers behind him and realised</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that he must actually have sighed in the presence of such beauty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Wonderful. Just wonderful.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That&#39;s as maybe, Mr Coldstream, but what sort of a wonderful</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">thing is it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh. It&#39;s some sort of an engine.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Even a man of my advancing years and brine-rinsed brain</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">can see that Mr Coldstream. I wish for you to tell me precisely what</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sort of an engine it is.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well, lets see then, the valve work here is quite marvellous,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and the precision of these fitments is ... these measurements cannot</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">be in inches.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed they are not, Mr Coldstream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;These are measurements of the metric system. These drawings</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">are French.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That would be a reasonable assumption.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex shuffled the papers in order to understand them better, cross-checked</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">from one to the next muttering to himself as he did some rough arithmetic</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and then squeezing the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">eyes closed as he calculated furiously. His eyes snapped open and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he scoured the drawings before him, his nose passing just inches above</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the paper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Missing. There is a sheet missing.&#39; he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is our understanding that the design is complete.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex ran a hand through his hair and shook his head, then began to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">dig through the drift of charts beneath the drawings. Beneath a map</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of Albemarle he found what he was looking for and returned the missing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sheet to the surface. He rearranged the drawings quickly and stood</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">back from the table to view his work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He laid one hand flat on the drawing at the centre of the design.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He drew his fingers together in a caress that became a fist which</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he struck softly against the side of his head. Then he stood and turned</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to face a bemused Collingwood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There was Fulton&#39;s work of course, but this is something</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of another order altogether.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Has this been built?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;so there is room for passion in those eyes, Coldstream. That is a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">good thing. A man without passion is like a ship without sails.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Admiral. Has this engine has been built.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That is a very important question Mr Coldstream and one</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">we must have the answer to. In the meantime perhaps you can tell us</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">what purpose it has?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex shook his head sadly, &#39;I cannot say.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I confess I find your answer a little disappointing, Mr</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Coldstream. Perhaps you could explain just what it is about this gewgaw</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that you find so moving.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;How powerful?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I cannot say for sure. More powerful by far than any engine</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">yet built. And the size of it ... It is inconceivable.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The room had grown very quiet. Alex felt almost as if he and Collingwood</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">were alone together. The admiral had drawn very close to him and placed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a hand on his shoulder. He looked at Alex with eyes that were steady</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">but which he knew were now afloat in rum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Mr Coldstream you have been of good service to me this evening,&#39; said the Admiral and fixed him with an iron stare that would have stopped a ship of the line in full sail, &#39;Now I would ask more of you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex nodded stiffly, he did not know what to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;We believe that the French have made great advances in this field. Have overtaken us in but a matter of months or years, we know not how. Mr Coldstream, in rooms such as this and at tables such as</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">this one powerful men talk in fearful voices of late. Always there</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is one fear at their shoulder. Always they mutter of the Engine Gap.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They say that we are outpaced, that iron ships and fire engines will</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">smash their way through the wooden walls that protect us, that traction</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">engines will crush English fields beneath their iron wheels on the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">way to London, that balloons steered against the wind by the power</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of steam will fill our skies with French muskets. Men think in strange</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ways when they are scared, Mr Coldstream, and men do strange things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Until these drawings were brought to me I thought that such talk of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the engine gap was idle nonsense. My greatest fear has always been</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that fear itself will drive us into the rash act, that we will lose</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">our heads and our reason. Now it seems that after all, there is some</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">basis to these fears. We must know the truth of it. We must know what</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the French are now capable of, what engines they have constructed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and what they plan to use them for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What would you have me do, sir?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;We need a man with an engineering eye to look over some</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">machinery that we believe to be of French origin. Real machinery,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">not plans.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I will gladly give you my opinion sir, though I would ask</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">why you feel my opinion is to be given such weight. Surely in a matter</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as vital as this one you might prevail upon Mr Stevenson, or even</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lord Bradford himself to help you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I might, but I will not.&#39; Collingwood looked around</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the room as if making certain that he recognised all of the occupants,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Men think in strange ways when they are scared, Mr Coldstream,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">especially when they are scared and are not accustomed to being scared.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is my belief that Lord Bradford is scared and that he has scared</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">all save a few of the engineers in this kingdom.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Sir, I am not sure that I understand you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I think perhaps that you do Mr Coldstream, nevertheless,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I will not press any more of my idle speculation upon you. I will</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">say only that your master was not in thrall to fear, nor indeed to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lord Bradford and neither, I am pleased to discover, are you. If your</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">master had lived, I would have sought his help. As it is, I have sought</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">yours.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Sir, I would gladly help you, but I have urgent business</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of my own to attend to.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Urgent? What can be more urgent than the defence of the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">realm, sir?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed it may not be, your Lordship, at least not in the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">wider scheme of the world, but I was given a commission by Master</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whirlaway as he lay dying, and I intend to see that it is completed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as he wished.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed? And what manner of commission was it that Whirlaway</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">gave to you?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was Alex&#39;s turn to look around the room to inspect those present,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Sir, I cannot tell you, at least not until I know more myself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My efforts so far have led me to you. It is my hope that you can help</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">me fulfil my master&#39;s dying wish.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well, then. It seems we have the makings of a bargain Mr</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Coldstream. I will undertake to help you in any capacity I can, if</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you will undertake to give us your engineer&#39;s opinion on the French</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">machinery. We should not detain you from your endeavours for more</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">than a day or two.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A day or two?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed, the machinery is located some way outside of London</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for sound reasons as I&#39;m sure you will appreciate. When you return,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I will help you as I have promised.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex felt a strange confusion within. He was so close to his goal,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">so close to discovering exactly what it was that his master had died</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to protect, but now he had to turn away from it. He knew that he had</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">no choice. He could not proceed without Collingwood&#39;s help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I will do as you ask, sir. I am sure that my master would</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">have wished it so.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Good, that is settled then. Stetson, more rum for Mr Coldstream!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">let us drink to our bargain, and then there is someone I would very</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">much like you to meet.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Coast Of Iron And Bronze</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Alex awoke his mind was very clear and very still. He reached</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for memory and found none. He knew only that he lay on an uncomfortable</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and unfamiliar bed. He sat up and looked out through a small round</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">window. The dark grey horizon sloped considerably upwards to his right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He watched for a moment as the slope of the horizon lessened, then</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">raised itself considerably upwards to his left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he threw up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After several very unpleasant minutes he made his way out of the cabin</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">on all fours and up onto the deck. He flung his arms over the nearest</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">rail and closed his eyes to shield himself from the sight of the surging</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">grey mass of the sea as his body purged itself of rum, sugar coated</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">dates and the last shreds of his tattered dignity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Good morning! Lovely day for it isn&#39;t it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex peered through watering eyes, trying to make out details of the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">grey shape that had spoken to him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t ...&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sagged back over the rail losing himself to the cry of gulls, and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the deep sea swell as he retched and retched and retched again. After</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a while he began to console himself with mathematics. He started from</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the undeniable engineering fact that his stomach had only a finite</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">capacity and then proceeded to prove mathematically, and much to his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">own satisfaction, that his predicament could not go on forever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At last, he drew himself upright once more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Look to windward Mr Coldstream, that&#39;s the way. Some salt</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">air on your face will see you right in short order.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lounging a little way along from him, against the rail of what Alex</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">could now see was a ship of no great size, was a stockily built man</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">with auburn hair and ruddy cheeks who was a good deal shorter than</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex and a great deal more cheerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Forgive me, I am afraid we have not been introduced, sir.&#39;said Alex weakly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man laughed. It was an unusually loud laugh that would have been</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">unpleasant and ill-mannered under any circumstances but which Alex</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">found particularly objectionable given the uncertain state of his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">constitution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I&#39;m damned if we haven&#39;t, sir!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He laughed again, and thrust out his hand, &#39;Good man! Good</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">man! A night that one can remember clearly is a night thoroughly wasted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am Peregrine Turnstile, as I explained to you last night.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Last night?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;At the admiralty. Cuthbert himself entrusted me with your</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">care.

Remember that. Speaking of which I distinctly</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">remember the admiral telling me that you never forget anything. Damned</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">useful trick I thought, though now it seems you are unable to recollect</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">anything of the evening just passed.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is the drink, sir. I am not used to it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Good job we got shot of that rum and stuck to the clean</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">stuff. It can punch a good hole in the old recollection though, I&#39;ll</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">give you that.&#39; Turnstile pulled a hip flask from his pocket</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and took a swig from it before thrusting it at Alex. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Fancy a drop?&#39; The faintest whiff of vodka reached</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex&#39;s nostrils and he wrestled for control of his insides.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Got a taste for it in Russia.

Bloody good sport.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex nodded grimly, his teeth clamped together. His understanding</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">was that the most recent Russian campaign was generally agreed to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">have been extremely bloody, but &#39;good sport&#39; was a phrase one seldom</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">heard used in connection with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;We appear to be on a boat,&#39; gulped Alex before clenching</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">his teeth again quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Sharp fellow! That&#39;s the ticket. Powers of observation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Important. Stand us in good stead when we get to France.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;France?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turnstile gave him a strange look, &#39;Of course France. That&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">where the bloody French are and their bloody engines.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But the admiral, he said -&#39; Alex tried to recall</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">clearly the conversation he had had with Collingwood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What did he say, old chap?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He said that the engines were located some distance from</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">London.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed. And here we are. Some distance from London and a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">little further to go. With luck and a fair wind we shall find ourselves</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">back in Whitehall by nightfall tomorrow.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not feel well.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Wages of sin, old chap. Wages of sin. A bloody good night</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">like last night? Well worth it. I won the Duke of Norham&#39;s daughters</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in a poker game, do you remember? Twin sisters. Gave the naughty one</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to you.

Please tell me that I did not.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Could not more like it. Had to take them both on myself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Spirited pair, though in my experience the notion of sisters is always</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">more appealing than the reality.&#39; &#39;falls the shadow&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The trick is never to properly sober up,&#39; said</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turnstile. He opened the cap of the hip flask and took a swig, &#39;Sure</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you won&#39;t have some?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Something rose within Alex and he returned himself to the cries of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the gulls and the miserable realisation that his mathematical solution</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">had neglected to consider the infinite nature of the asymptote.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[They land on the French coast and make their way to a dock on a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">river]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that cannot be all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turnstile was sketching furiously, &#39;Mr Coldstream I would</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">be grateful if you could note as many impressions of the vessel as</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you can, making use of your engineers eye and your unusual facility</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But this cannot be the thing we have come to see?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And why not, it seems like the sort of remarkable thing that Monsieur</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bonaparte would be keen to hide, and which Admiral Collingwood would</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">be keen to know about it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But it is not enough sir. It is a ship driven by steam,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I will grant you, and an uncommonly large and well made one. But it</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is not a craft of war. I am not a naval man Mr Turnstile, but that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">vessel does not look very capable at all. In fact, it looks designed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">more to carry freight than marines or cannon. The lack of masts is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">remarkable is it not? Not simply because there are no sails, but because</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the main deck is completely flat.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What is your point Mr Coldstream?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;She is rather broad, don&#39;t you think, in the beam, with</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a great flat deck, and winching equipment at each end. This vessel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seems to have been designed to carry something of great size.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It may be that whatever the intended cargo was is the true</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">prize here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turnstile stopped drawing and studied the vessel carefully, nodding</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">thoughtfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, Mr Coldstream, perhaps we&#39;ll make a secret agent of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What sort of a thing is it do you suppose that such a ship could carry?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Almost anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Those rails sir, along the dockside.

The hook swung again and struck Alex on the shoulder,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">knocking him from his seat. A third swing hooked them fast and drew</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">them towards the wooden walls of the warship. As their tiny boat bumped</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">alongside, Alex saw a tricorned head appear above the rail above them,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">little more than a silhouette against the swirling white mist that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">surrounded them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well, well, well, what have we here? Why, as I live and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">breathe, if it isn&#39;t Mr Turnstile! What an honour you do us sir, visiting</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">us as we ply our humble trade, keeping the shores of England safe</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for whores and cuckolds.

There was the sound of muffled</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">blows. Alex saw the dark shape of a head appear over the rail coughing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and spluttering. A pair of bloody teeth fell into the boat at Alex&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">feet. The head disappeared from the rail and then the sound of more</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">blows came down to him through the mist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex heard Captain Wrathbone speaking again, &#39;You must forgive</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">my men Mr Turnstile. They were certain that we had captured a French</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">spy attempting to enter the country.

What characteristics would it have as an</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">artillery piece?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That would all depend, sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Depend on what? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well, assuming the weapon is built as described, with a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">shell of a yard or more in diameter, one could expect, it -&#39;the lieutenant&#39;s face broke out in a smile and he shook his head,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;forgive me sir, the whole thing is ludicrous, when one considers</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the explosive impulse of a shell of such a size. These are dreams,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sir. Nothing more.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;How so, sir?&#39; thundered Turvey, wiping the smile</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">from the lieutenant&#39;s face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;These plans call for steel, sir. Steel.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turvey glowered. Alex realised that this was the expression that the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">admiral chose when he was confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lieutenant Richardson seemed a little exasperated to find himself</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">still talking about a subject he had already explained was a fantasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Steel is manufactured by the grain, sir. Not by the ounce</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and certainly not by the kilogram or the blasted metric tonne. Excuse</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">my French.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was silence while the information sought permission to board</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the admiral&#39;s understanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what is your opinion, Mr Coldstream?&#39; asked</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood at length.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I have no opinion, sir. I have simply reproduced the plans</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as I saw them. I would add that Mr Turnstile and I saw a very large</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">item of worked metal that was almost certainly this piece that is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">used to block the breech of the gun&#39;, he said, tapping the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">plans, &#39;It was not made of iron. If I were to venture anything</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">speculative on the matter I would suggest that perhaps the French</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">know something that we do not about the manufacture of steel. When</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">one considers how far our own knowledge of metallurgy has come in</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">this last twenty years, it does not seem so remarkable to me to think</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that there are processes by which one could make and work steel in</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">such quantities.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Lieutenant Richardson, would you humour an old man and describe</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the effects of this weapon for us?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Of course sir, I did not mean, that is to say -&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood waved him on impatiently. The Lieutenant cleared his throat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and began again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A shell one yard in diameter would likely have an explosive</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">charge of {[400] pounds of powder, assuming of course that they {*are{*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">using powder,&#39; he shot a dark look at Alex and continued,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;and assuming that the strength of worked steel at this scale</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is capable of containing the blast, we might expect a shell with a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">weight not exceeding perhaps one hundred pounds and which would have</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a muzzle velocity of over four hundred miles per hour. With an optimal</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">trajectory, the shell might ascend to an altitude of over two thousand</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">feet and I would estimate that the range to target could be anywhere</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">from fifty to seventy miles.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was silence again. Turvey glowered. Cochrane and Collingwood</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">exchanged looks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Seventy miles?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes. In principle.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood rose from his seat and walked to the window, nodding to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">himself as he did so. He looked out towards the observatory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;So, it is capable of throwing a shell from the French coast</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">into the heart of London. Can you imagine gentlemen?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What would the explosion of such a shell be like Gray?&#39; asked Cochrane loafing backwards in his chair and stirring what was</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">left of his tea with a speculative air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is difficult to say. One would imagine that the shell</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">casing itself would need to be strong to survive the initial firing,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and even if one assumes it to be made of steel, it would still be</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a sizable proportion of the total weight. We could reckon perhaps</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seventy pounds of powder per shell.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It would make a great mess of a ship. What would the effect</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">be on a city?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It would level any building it hit and perhaps those adjacent</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to it.&#39; said Gray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Hmph. He has one gun only. He would destroy our city one</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">street at a time? Then it will take him a while sir!&#39; fumed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turvey &#39;A good long while!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Indeed, though it need not be an explosive shell for all</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that. Imagine if it were packed with material suitable for raising</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a fire.&#39; said Cochrane.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was silence as his grim pondering was considered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Imagine a great series of fires breaking out at the pool</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of London, or along the dockside. The loss to shipping and to trade.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Bonaparte has perfected this weapon and can bring it to bear against</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">us, how can we fight it?.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood turned away from the window and returned to his seat,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">shaking his head, &#39;I think that you do not quite understand</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the situation gentlemen. Lieutenant, tell us, what would it be like</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to be present when the shell struck.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I think I have explained, sir, the force is sufficient -&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood shook his head again, &#39;No, Lieutenant, not the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">effects in terms of damage to property, tell us what would it be like</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for an observer. The Londoner - man, woman or child - unfortunate</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">enough to be standing on a street on which this blasphemy fell.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gray looked confused, &#39;Well, it is difficult to know. I suppose</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the first thing would be that the shell would arrive at a speed of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">almost three hundred miles per hour. You would scarcely have heard</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">it before it struck. Then, if you were within a hundred feet or so,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the blast would be enough to kill you outright I should say. Beyond</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that, you might live to tell the tale but the heat and noise of it</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">would be certain to take a great toll on the nerves of those not hardened</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to such things. It would be as if a magazine had exploded, I suppose</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">we have all seen something of the sort, though usually at a distance.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood nodded, &#39;At the Nile the {*bellerophon{* went</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">up ... we dragged men from the water that had been blown out of their</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">clothes and burned across every inch of their bodies. The lesson,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">gentlemen, is this. Bonaparte does not need to destroy the whole city,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">or even any large part of it. The shell would always get through,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">don&#39;t you see. That is the true horror of it. There is no help for</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">it. And how will the people of London respond I wonder? Do you think</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">we have seen disorder in our cities in recent years? No, I think not.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Have we seen panic in a populous of millions. No, we have not.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even now people are fleeing. No one can live under such a monstrous</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Now then gentlemen, are there any further questions for</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mr Coldstream?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even a mind as gifted as yours could not conceive of a device capable</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of defending us against it. Our only hope would be to attack and seize</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the gun itself, and yet ... Do you not think that Bonaparte will seek</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to protect this monstrous thing in a fortress, to ring it around with</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">battalions of men and cannon. Indeed he will. Our spies report fortifiication</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">work and deep excavation at five different sites along the channel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">coast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Five?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whether he means to build five of these monsters, or simply to keep</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">us guessing at the location of the one is not yet known. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Five ... it is almost inconeivable. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am an engineer sir, not a magician. I work with iron and steam.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If these drawings were not so terribly detailed, had not been so revised</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and amended, I would dismiss them as a work of fantasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But these are real drawings sir, and real plans. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A weapon that could strike at London herself. A weapon that could</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">not be silenced. Such a thing cannot be conceived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I assure you sir that it has been conceived, indeed it is my belief</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that such a thing is even now being {*constructed{* and is intended</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for use against us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[In return for his help,Collingwood tells Alex what he knows about</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whirlaway,not much, except that the last clock belonged to Lord Marchpane.]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I had thought that perhaps you had had him killed.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Because I do not trust Lord Bradford.

I know that he trusted</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you. There is something that he asked me to do. In fact sir, It was</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the last thing that he asked me to do, and so I am bound to do it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And you believe that I can help you to carry out your master&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">last wish?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps. I know that you commissioned several pieces from</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">my master.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That is true.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It was Master Whirlaway&#39;s wish that I find certain of his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">clocks again.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;For what purpose, Mr Coldstream.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not know, sir.

It is not always a virtue.

It may help if you could provide a list of all of the clocks that my Master made for you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood looked dubious. &#39;There is the mantel clock at</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grey End. I believe that you presented yourself there to clean it</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">quite recently, so you know of that one, and there is a case clock</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in my rooms at the admiralty. Those were the only clocks I had him</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">make for my own purposes. There are the marine chronometers. Your</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">master was commissioned to make nineteen of those for various ships</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of the line, the majority, alas, are now keeping Greenwich time at</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the bottom of the ocean.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex waited for Collingwood to continue, but he did not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I believe that is everything.&#39; said the Admiral</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as the silence became uncomfortable. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You are sure, sir?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violent red storm clouds immediately rose in Collingwood&#39;s cheeks</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and the thunder broke across Alex, &#39;Your master never charged</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">less than a hundred guineas for one of his damned clocks. It is the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sort of purchase that one remembers, sir. Of course I am sure!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I am sorry, your lordship. I did not mean to be impertinent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The matter is of some importance to me.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Collingwood&#39;s anger subsided a little, &#39;Indeed. It is important</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that a man keep his word. I am sorry I cannot help you further. You</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">have been helpful Mr Coldstream. These are dangerous days, and we</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">can be glad of any help that we can find.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex nodded. &#39;Sir, if there is nothing further, then I would</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">take my leave of you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex headed for the door, his mind clouded with the darkness of a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">depression.

Living</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">only to defend this great land of ours from an ever present danger?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Something of that.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well perhaps there is some truth in it, especially in these</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">dark days, there is little help for it but to commit oneself totally</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to the task in hand. I was not always so noble minded. Most men have</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">weaknesses Mr Coldstream. Mine was cards.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The Tarreau?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Don&#39;t be a fool man! Playing cards. Gambling. Damn near</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">lost everything I ever won at sea over a game of cards, on more than</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">one occasion.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And who was the man who beat you?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Marchpane. Army type. He was a captain, so was I. Now he&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a general, though God himself knows how. Nasty piece of work. Cruel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sort. Impressed a few of Liverpool&#39;s crowd during the last run in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ruthlessness is good for one&#39;s career it seems. At any rate he won</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the watch from me. What he has done with it, I cannot say. I believe</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that he is in the Caribbean at present, though it would surprise me</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">if he still owned the piece. He was an even greater gambler than I.&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He had a batman named Chard.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex sets out to find the last piece of the Whirlaway engine. He asks</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Poynter for help. They hire Chard who served under Marchpane and knows</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">what happened to the final part of the engine. It is not part of a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">clock, it is part of a watch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I need help, Percy.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What kind of help?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I need to find a man called Chard. A soldier that served</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">with the Newcastle Light Infantry at the time of the March.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The NLI? Well, there is an obvious place to start.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Where?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;In the Heart Of The Light of course.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Heart Of The Light</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Sorted.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When the man spoke, Alex could tell that he was from the North. But it was not his North of empty hills, windswept beaches and ancient stone cities, rather, Alex knew that he was born of one of those red brick shanties that clung to the belching factories, crowding together on the damp clay and stony rubbish of the new born cities, coal blackened cancers that were rootless and without foundations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not catch your meaning, sir. &nbsp;The innkeeper told us that you were Chard. &nbsp;Is that so?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man was hunched over at a table in the shadow of the corner and draped in a shapeless greatcoat that was almost glossy with a sheen of filth. &nbsp;His hands rested together, as if in prayer, on the rim of a tankard. When Percy spoke, two green eyes rolled upwards in watery sockets behind lank tentacles of greasy hair and a face that was pocked and riven with scars was lifted towards them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You have sorted me out, as wheat from chaff. &nbsp;I am Chard.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He drained the tankard then set the empty vessel down and began to regard them with a gaze that Alex found immediately unnerving. &nbsp;It was like that of a baby, Alex suddenneither judging nor moved but simply \emph{looking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps you would like another drink, Mr Chard?&#39; said Percy presently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That is a sound plan, sir. Sound.&#39; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Three tankards were delivered to the table. &nbsp;Chard picked his up immediately and began to drink. &nbsp;Alex looked at Percy. &nbsp;Percy shrugged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Mr Chard, I would like to ask you some questions,&#39; said Alex, who had struggled in vain as always to bring to mind a suitable pretext for the conversation he wished to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard nodded. &nbsp;Alex began to feel uncomfortable, as if he were applying pressure to a stuck lever or gear train which might suddenly give and unbalance him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is about your military service, that is to say the war.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It was not my fault, sir,&#39; Chard said levelly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What was not your fault?&#39; said Alex, surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The war. &nbsp;It was already ongoing when I found myself in France.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stared at him in confusion, then looked at Percy who was chuckling into his pint, and then back to Chard. &nbsp;Alex came to the sudden realisation that somewhere very far away behind the pondwater green of the man&#39;s eyes and the damaged impassive bark of his face, Chard was laughing at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Quite. &nbsp;I had not meant to suggest that it was you who had started the war. &nbsp;I wished to ask you about those you served with. &nbsp;In particular about Lord Marchpane.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard glanced at Alex. &nbsp;A movement that was very much quicker than any he had so far demonstrated to them. &nbsp; Then he drank and was silent for a good long while. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You wear a soldier&#39;s coat, but you are not a soldier,&#39; said Chard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No sir, I am not. I do not pretend to be.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is as well that you do not.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The coat belonged to my brother.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And he has no further need of it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He has not.&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard nodded thoughtfully, &#39;But he did not leave it in France</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sir, as so many of his comrades did.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex shook his head, &#39;No the coat returned with my brother</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in it, but something of him remained in France. Whatever it was it</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seemed that he could not live without it. The coat is all I have left</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of him.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard nodded again and drank deeply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I will not offer you my sympathy sir for you have no need of it and I have none to give,&#39; Chard drank again and fixed Alex with a gaze as real as a bayonet, &#39;But I understand.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I was no more than a boy sir when they brought me the drum. &nbsp;They had taken it from the hands of the lad who went before me, name of Billy Clapham. &nbsp;Still had blood on it. &nbsp;There was only one drumstick. &nbsp;The other must have been trampled underfoot, just like the boy.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A stick in the mud,&#39; said Percy to himself. &nbsp;Alex looked at him in horror but found the poet staring into space in the way he did sometimes when composing. &nbsp;He knew that Percy was moved by the story in his own way, seeing some deeper meaning in it than Alex could. &nbsp;To his relief it seemed that Chard had not heard him at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;One stick is no good sirs, no good at all for war drumming. &nbsp;If one is to drive men to their deaths then what is needed is a proper rattle.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;&quot;Use your initiative lad,&quot; was what my sergeant said to me. &nbsp;So I made new sticks. &nbsp;A pair, whittled from a bit of old tent pole snatched from a fire. &nbsp;You have to make a pair see, to get the balance right. &nbsp;Carve them in one piece and then split them down the middle.&#39; &nbsp;Chard made a cutting motion with his hand. &nbsp;&#39;And then I learned to drum sirs. &nbsp;A lad from another company showed me how and I worked harder at that than anything else I had done before. &nbsp;Hour after hour with the sticks all bound up with rags to keep them quiet like.&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He drummed out a quiet tattoo on the table&#39;s edge with the index fingers of each hand. &nbsp;For all the sound was soft and slow, Alex felt the chill wind of the battlefield passing across the back of his neck. &nbsp;He shivered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But then there was the matter of the other stick.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The \emph{other stick?&#39; asked Alex. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Billy Clapham&#39;s stick. &nbsp;I kept it see. &nbsp;Couldn&#39;t throw it away. &nbsp;It was all that was left of him. &nbsp;I carried it around in my pack for months and after a while I began to fancy that it was speaking to me.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Poynter&#39;s eyes had drifted upwards to the ceiling and gently closed. &nbsp;Now they snapped open and he sprang forward, leaning in towards Chard, &#39;It \emph{spoke to you?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard drank and nodded slowly, &#39;After a fashion. &nbsp;Not words as such, not really. &nbsp;Or if there were words they were only those as I had put there myself. &nbsp;But the very fact that it was there in my pack, soaked in the blood of Billy Clapham, well, after a while it began to play on my mind sir, in a manner of speaking. &nbsp;Before long that was all I could think on, and that was when I started to think what it was the stick was trying to tell me. &nbsp;When it spoke as it were.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what did it say?&#39; asked Poynter, causing Alex to writhe in discomfort at what he assumed was a sarcastic comment, but then blink in surprise when he realised that it was not, and that Poynter was leaning forward and waiting for Chard&#39;s next utterance with a genuine wide-eyed eagerness that it seemed to him he had not seen since Percy had been a boy pestering travellers at the coaching inn near their home for news of the wide world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It wanted to be played sir, was all. &nbsp;It took me a long time to think on it, but that was all in the end. &nbsp;It seemed right somehow. &nbsp;Like a part of Billy Clapham was still playing. &nbsp;Like not all of him had died in that fucking French field.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And so you played the drum with it again?&#39; asked Poynter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I did sir. &nbsp;But at the same time, I couldn&#39;t just throw out one of my own sticks. &nbsp;I was too used to them by that time. &nbsp;The drum was a part of me. &nbsp;So I played with three sticks. &nbsp;At first I just held Billy&#39;s stick alongside one of my own, in my right hand like this,&#39; he showed them the shape of his weathered hand, &#39;but after a while, I got to trying other things. &nbsp;Both sticks working separately but together, if you see my meaning.&#39; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He began to drum on the table again, but this time used two fingers from his right hand, a quicker rhythm that rose and fell in tempo and timbre that made Alex feel sad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;They called me The Man With Three Staves.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;From the tarreau card?&#39; asked Percy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stared in wonder and then drank a long draught.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;We craved the battle. We were mad for it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You wear a soldier&#39;s coat, but you are not a soldier&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No sir, I am not. I do not pretend to be.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is as well that you do not.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The coat belonged to my brother.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And he has no further need of it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He has not.&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard nodded thoughtfully, &#39;But he did not leave it in France</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sir, as so many of his comrades did.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex shook his head, &#39;No the coat returned with my brother</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in it, but something of him remained in France. Whatever it was it</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seemed that he could not live without it.

None of my family could read. Does that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seem foolish? I wrote for hope. For comfort. For luck.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;She was a constant thing. Constant. Do you understand me sir? She</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">would always be there, always carry on, unroken by the world. Like</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a river, no, better, a waterfall.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[Peterloo]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;With the rest of the women and girls from her factory and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">all of the other factories. They say there were a hundred thousand</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of them gathered there that day. I wish only that I had been there</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to see it. Four hundred of those gathered did not return home that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">night. Elizabeth was one of them.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;They call it Peterloo,as if to make some great battle of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">it. But it was no battle. No battle at all. At Waterloo there were</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">no women run down by horses, no girls run through with cavalry sabres,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">no unarmed mill hands blasted with muskets. Not by the Frenchies,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">not by the Prussians and damn well not by us. Cowardly bastards.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I found him sir. Later. We had been sent to Ireland in Twenty One.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was talk of Bony landing there and stirring up trouble with</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the bogtrotters. Insurrection, that sort of thing. The {[gdsgg] cavalry</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">were there with us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I found him sir. Found the tent where he slept and I went there one</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">night and I slit his throat.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex looked at the red rims of Chard&#39;s eyes and all at once realised</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">just how dangerous a man was sitting across from him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The army offer men gold sir, but it is fool&#39;s gold.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The man is made of stone.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That was the way of it. Say what you like about Bony. Men</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">call him mad. Call him wicked. Call him greedy, call him short. But</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">no one ever calls him stupid do they? There are reasons for that,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sir. He didn&#39;t spend all of his time coming back from Moscow thinking</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">about how cold his toes were, or where he could get a hot croissant,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">now did he?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The old soldier thrust his face towards Alex seeking affirmation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I really couldn&#39;t say.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No, he did not. He spent his time thinking on how he&#39;d been</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">beaten, and how, when it come down to it, what the Russians had done</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to him was sound strategy sir. Sound.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Lovely language, Russian,&#39; Poynter said dreamily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And that&#39;s what he did to us as you well know sirs.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex set his face in a look of polite interest as if to suggest to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard that further elaboration would be welcome, but Chard needed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">no encouragement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;In Sixteen, when Welly had got over his pox we all set out</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">campaigning again. Champing at the bit we was, men and officers both,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time we&#39;ll finish him off for sure lads. So off we goes</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">haring around France trying to hold him to a proper ding-dong, but</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bony just keeps falling back and falling back. Our wagon train getting</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">longer, his getting shorter. His men melting away into the villages</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and the farms, us picking up all sorts of riff-raff and camp followers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it&#39;s just a matter of time, that&#39;s what Welly says &#39;Just</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a matter of time men, we&#39;ll have him before the summer is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">out!&#39; But of course, that was the thing. That was the thing!&#39;Chard chuckled craftily and took a long draught from his tankard. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he sat perfectly still and stared into space.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Excuse me, um, Mr Chard, you were saying?&#39; said</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Poynter after a minute had passed and Chard had shown no signs of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">returning from his reverie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Saying what now?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You said &#39;That was the thing.&#39; you seemed quite sure on</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">this point.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Did I?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes. You said that the Duke had promised you would have</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bonaparte before the summer was out and, unless I have mistaken your</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">meaning, \emph{that was the thing.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard chuckled, &#39;Indeed it was sir, indeed it was.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But why?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Because there wasn&#39;t no summer. Not that year, nor the next.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not so as you&#39;d notice any how. June and July we tramped up and down</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">roads no better than rivers, every man and horse head to toe in mud.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mud in your eyes, mud in your rifle, mud in your mouth. There was</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">gales went on for days and hailstones bigger than fists smashing down</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">all over. Week after week of slogging around, never drying out, never</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">resting and come August everyone starts to get a bit itchy.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Some sort of canker or rot?&#39; volunteered Poynter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Not that kind of itchy. We&#39;re marching up and down all over,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">see? All over the whole country and every field we march past is empty.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All the soil&#39;s smashed up by the rain and every stalk of corn is broken</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">over by the wind and the hail and it don&#39;t take a farmer to tell you</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">there&#39;s going to be no kind of harvest this year. When the harvest</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fails its hard on the folks what live on the land, but they make a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">go of it. There&#39;s always a little put by, a bit more work put into</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">stretching things a little further and all them things that you can</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">eat but don&#39;t if you don&#39;t have to.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Like Mrs Appletree&#39;s Special Pies.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex glowered at Poynter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That&#39;s all fine well, if you&#39;re a farmer not got his harvest</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in, but if you&#39;re an army of fifty thousand men and the same again</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">hanging on whoring and thieving, well sir, then you&#39;re in a mess.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A proper mess. The news from England&#39;s no better. They&#39;ve got nothing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to spare and even if they did we&#39;re hundreds of muddy miles from the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ports. What&#39;s to be done?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The March,&#39; said Alex quietly as if understanding</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">something for the first time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The March is what they called it after. When they painted</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">all those fine paintings and wrote all those fine poems.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Bastard, bastard Shelley, damn his eyes,&#39; muttered</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Poynter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But it wasn&#39;t a march sir, it was a bloody shambles. That&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a strange thing sir, a very strange thing indeed.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What is, Mr Chard?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;One day we&#39;re an army, marching forward, rank and file.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hungry and tired and missing home, but orderly. Soldierly. The next</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">day, there&#39;s nothing but a mob trampling each other into the mud.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nothing had changed. Nothing had changed sir except one thing.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what was that, Mr Chard?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;We weren&#39;t going forward. &nbsp;Soon as we knew we was</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">going for home, that was it. We&#39;d been doing five miles a day in the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">last bit of the advance. Soon as we turned around it was ten and fifteen</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and more. Each company competing with the next to see who could get</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">on the furthest. We knew there was nothing left. &nbsp;Nothing back</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">there the way we&#39;d come. If you weren&#39;t at the head of the column you starved,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and even if were there was no guarantees. There&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">some terrible sights to be seen in the world sirs. Terrible sights.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard drank again and the silence weighed heavily upon them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It wasn&#39;t any kind of picture that could be painted nor poem that could be written neither. I saw things</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in those weeks that I can&#39;t think on, nor less speak of. I saw men</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">eating the leaves from the trees. I saw men eating their belts and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">their bootstraps. I have seen men fight and kill for a handful of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">acorns. I have seen ...&#39; his voice broke and trembled and it seemed for a moment as if he would lose control of himself entirely, but then thought better of it and said quietly &#39;I have seen terrible sights, sirs. Terrible sights.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chard drank once more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And all the time there was Bony and his boys nipping at our heels. &nbsp;Not an army, just skirmishers, only a few companies moving fast alongside us through the woods and hedgerows. Getting food from the peasants what have hidden it from us, scouting out the road ahead, setting up ambushes, picking off the slow and the weak, grinding us down. Crossing them rivers was the worst. The bloody Somme and the bloody Marne. Slows everyone down the river crossings see. Everyone slipping and sliding in the mud, horses and gun carriages all fouled up, officers with no fight in &#39;em trying to draw up squares.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That&#39;s when Bony showed up.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;All that was left of us all stumbling and crowding our way down onto blasted Dunkerque Strand and nothing there but sand and gulls. &nbsp;Many was the man that just kept on. &nbsp;Wading out into the waves till Neptune took him. &nbsp;When the tide turned there was a dark line of &#39;em all along the beach there all tangled up with weeds and old nets. &nbsp;Terrible things, the gulls sir. &nbsp;They start off scared. &nbsp;But soon as they realise that you aren&#39;t to be scared of no more, well ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And every hour more of us turning up on the beach there. &nbsp;Just waiting to die. &nbsp;The sky was a terrible colour that day sir. &nbsp;It had stopped raining for a spell, but that was no mercy for there was no water on that beach that could be drunk. &nbsp;And the sky looked like bruises sir. &nbsp;The clouds all dark and low and moving fast across us. &nbsp;The gulls got swept this way and that above us. &nbsp;When a squall caught them. &nbsp;The wind that is. &nbsp;When the wind took a gull unawares like. &nbsp;They dropped whatever it was they had in their beaks sirs. &nbsp;There&#39;s no other way to say it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Not a sail to be seen out on the sea. &nbsp;And that was all grey and green and chopped up like a field at plough time. &nbsp;All there was for us was to look out onto the water, at the purple horizon, looking for the sails sir. &nbsp;But there was none.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Course, we didn&#39;t know what was happening in London. &nbsp;But the political men had called us dead already. &nbsp;Said we had to save the fleet to stop Bony pushing on into the Ocean. &nbsp;Liverpool and all those other bastards looking at columns of numbers were there were men dying in the foam on Dunkerque Strand. &nbsp;But then Harrison and his men made it back from Calais, sailed all the way up the Thames. &nbsp;They carried him to the admiralty in a sedan chair. &nbsp;He was screaming and raving at them, lost a leg the day before but sailed some leaky riverboat across the channel and up the Thames. &nbsp;Dumped him on the marble of the Admiralty, all mud and blood, pointing a pistol at anyone who came near, screaming for Collingwood. &nbsp;And Collingwood came. &nbsp;And he made &#39;em put Harrison in his office and sent &#39;em all out.&#39; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Some say it was two minutes and some say three, and none knows what Harrison said because he died that afternoon, but after no more than three minutes Collingwood stormed out of the admiralty, went straight</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">down to the Pool of London, took charge of every ship there, including</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the foreign ones and set sail right there and then. I will tell you this for no charge sirs, they can build his column as high as they like. &nbsp;I would shift the stones myself. &nbsp;I have never seen anything quite as wonderful in this world as the sails of Collingwood&#39;s Armada and the long boats coming out to meet us. He brought them right in, I mean right in, ran four of the bastards aground, all guns blazing, the cannons going over our heads and holding Bony off long enough to get us off that blasted beach.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I&#39;ve fought in Sorento, Quebec, Hautefort, Moscow, Lisbon, Madrid, Gibraltar and all the rest.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Moscow?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes. &nbsp;I was there in the last lot. &nbsp;A bad bloody business. &nbsp;The worst yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A watch? He was an infantry captain, of course he had a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">watch.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Signalman</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You asked me about clocks, sir. &nbsp;I do not undertake to divulge military secrets for no purpose. &nbsp;The ciphering engine is a closely held secret and no business of yours.&#39;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex visits the semaphore tower and discovers the final element of the whirlaway engine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a thunderous clattering above him and for a moment Alex though that the machinery had failed somehow and was crashing towards him. &nbsp;Then he realised that it had simply begun operation and was now thrashing and thumping like a steam-powered loom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The engine means we can send fifty letters a minute,&#39; Dawes bawled into his ear, though Alex barely heard him above the din, &#39;That is twice as fast as a man can do it, and of course the rate can be sustained for as long as is necesary. &nbsp;The real benefit is in the cipherment, as of course you are aware sir.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Of course.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex gazed in wonder at the engine. &nbsp;His eyes followed the taut wires that led from the clockwork upwards into the body of the semaphore mechanism. &nbsp;He found something compelling about the marriage of his master&#39;s engine and the heavy machinery of the semaphore. &nbsp;He reached out to touch a cable where it still vibrated after the last burst of activity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Careful sir, do not touch the line, it can get hot.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A hot line to Paris. &nbsp;Is it used often?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Not for the intended purpose, not very often sir. &nbsp;I think the Admiral prefers the old methods by and large.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dawes led the way into a little room that had a tiny casement window with a view of the observatory. &nbsp;He shut the felt-lined door and Alex found his ears suddenly ringing in the relative quiet of what he could now see was Dawes&#39; office. &nbsp;There was a narrow bookcase filled with ledgers, a desk with a worn leather top and a tiny grate that stood empty and cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You see that little expense is spared on us poor operatives sir, but a Signal Man needs very little.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You say that the line is rarely used. &nbsp;How can you know that it will work? &nbsp;That the French are waiting for your messages whenever you wish to send them?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Well sir, there are the tests of course.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You \emph{test the semaphore? &nbsp;But how?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Nothing could be easier sir. &nbsp;Each week the Froggies send us a sealed message by diplomatic bag and each week they send a signal by semaphore and we open up the message and hope they match. &nbsp;We do the same for them. &nbsp;Keeps everyone on their toes. &nbsp;Don&#39;t know when the message is coming in see, or if it&#39;s real until we open up the sealed one.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what do they send?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Very dull sir - mostly. &nbsp;Weather reports and lists of historical events all in terms of their ungodly calendar.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what do you send?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Ah well now, we get a bit more creative see. &nbsp;I sent &#39;em my Sally&#39;s recipe for hotpot once. &nbsp;These days it&#39;s mostly poetry.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Poetry?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh yes, but what I do is I mix it up see. &nbsp;Got to send them something they couldn&#39;t already have. &nbsp;So I likes to take one line from one poem, one line from another. &nbsp;Change the words around, that sort of thing.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Now then. &nbsp;The Admiral&#39;s message says you have come to make an adjustment to the ciphering engine.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes, I believe that it shall not take long.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A parallel piece of the engine, complete in its own way slipped away into his hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He is mixing up the poetry? &nbsp;Good God Alex, it is no wonder we have gone to the dogs!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Sounds like the monster Shelley&#39;s bitch of a wife dreamed up. &nbsp;All pieces fastened together. &nbsp;No harmony. &nbsp;No whole.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Human Engine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Who would have thought that a machine could move itself</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">faster than a horse can run?

I have come to love the gun.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Have you heard about &#39;Duck and Cover&#39;? It&#39;s terribly naughty,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">but simply everyone is doing it. Poll said that she hadn&#39;t had quite</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">so many gentlemen under her petticoats since the coronation.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;They say he has only managed to build one. Apparently he</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">has lost his engineer. It is most dreadfully careless of him.

Let him build more guns.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, we should help him!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I have heard it suggested that certain of our engineers</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">have already made endeavours along those lines.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turnstile turned to Alex and spoke in a manner that was suddenly measured</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and calm, &#39;Those are reckless words Mr Coldstream, and ones</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you would do well not to repeat in the hearing of others.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Dog Far Hence</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Brunel? Oh no, Brunel is quite mad, I assure you.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Master Whirlaway once told me of a time &shy;- &#39;, Alex</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">stopped and then smiled to himself, pleased that he at last understood</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">something that had long puzzled him, &#39; - of \emph{the time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The time in which he built this. He was young, very young and just</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">begun on his clocks. He said that one morning he woke and it was as</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">if quicksilver flowed in his mind. One idea following from the next.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He built a great tower of them, each more fantastic than the last.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He did not tell me of the engine, only that he had spent a period</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of some months in a kind of trance where everything had seemed simple,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">where each step forward had been easy and assured. I had thought that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he had built clocks, but now I know that the engine was the fruit</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of that time. I think he thought that if he told me of his annus mirabilis</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">it might inspire me to have a similar experience. Alas, the quicksilver</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">has eluded me. Forgive me, I must seem foolish.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Isobel shook her head, &#39;Indeed not. Quite the contrary. I</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">understand that of which your master spoke. There was a time when</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">quicksilver ran in my mind too.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stopped working and looked at her with a smile, &#39;Really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And what was the fruit of your labours? Not a Whirlaway Engine?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No. It was something terrible.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps then, that is to say, did you, \emph{were you, rather,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I mean -&#39; he looked up at her face and found the soft harmony</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of curves there to be so beautiful that he felt for a moment as if</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he were looking through the world into the realm of forms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Was I afraid? I have been afraid my whole life. Sometimes</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think that all of us are afraid, all of the time. I see much in</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the world that would confirm it.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps,&#39; said Alex considering her hypothesis,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;though I think that there was a time when I was not afraid.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;When was that?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;When I was a child. Before Dougal went to war. Before I</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">was apprenticed to Whirlaway. Perhaps it was because I was ignorant</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of the world, but I do not remember that I lived in fear.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A child? Eight or nine? Before Waterloo. Were you not scared</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of invasion then, of Bonaparte at your door?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex smiled as he remembered, &#39;Oh yes. Terribly afraid, but</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">only as much as we were scared of ghosts and strange beasts upon the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">hills. He was a fire side tale, not real to us, though there had been</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">so much war even then.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what was real to you?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I kept a stickleback in a jar. In summer the bracken would</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">grow taller than we were and if you walked within it on a hot day</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the richness of its scent was intoxicating. In winter, on a still</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">night, we would walk across the snow into the fields and lie on our</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">backs looking up at the clear stars that shone without twinkling and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the silence deafened us. Now, even after everything, these things</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seem more real to me than almost anything else.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I have been scared. I have run. I have hidden. I have done</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">whatever I have had to do to survive. This has been my life. I cannot</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">pretend to be other than I am.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what are you?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not know any more.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He reached out and took her hand, felt the tension in her as she made</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to move away, and then the control being exercised as she did not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I remember that you collected hyacinths in Killarnock&#39;s</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">garden one day when it was raining. That is how I have always remembered</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">you. The hyacinth girl.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What is it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;An engine. A quite marvellous engine.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It looks more like a clock.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is no clock.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But what does it do?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I believe that it is a thinking engine.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Thinking? But how?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I believe that it can think those thoughts that it is told</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to think. It can think them through to their ends.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But how. I do not understand. How can one tell a machine</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to think?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex&#39;s eyes sparkled as he spoke, &#39;I think that as yet I</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">can see but a shadow of the whole, but even that is marvellous. The</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">machine is only a piece of his achievement, don&#39;t you see? He has</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">invented a language for thought. One so precise it may be written</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in the teeth of wheels. So elegant. So intelligent.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And the engine can hear this thought language?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex laughed out loud and hugged himself as the realisation came to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">him, &#39;Oh! So much more, don&#39;t you see? It can hear it and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{*speak{* it. It can {*think{* about that which you tell it and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">respond.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She watched the wheels as they span and chattered back and forth,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what is it thinking?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex stood, staring at the device, savouring the moment before he</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">acknowledged to himself that which he knew to be true. A smile spread</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">slowly from ear to ear, his head bobbed slowly, and then faster as</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he breathed the words aloud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is Whirlaway.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Roots That Clutch</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had watched the thing in curious silence for several minutes as</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex paced backwards and forwards muttering to himself in excitement,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">periodically pulling at his hair or slapping his head, or letting</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">out great exclamatory laughs as he tried to explore the wonder of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">it within his own mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a very strange sort of engine. Unlike any clockwork device</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">or steam engine that she had ever seen, there seemed to be no pattern</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to its noise or motion. It chattered and clicked and whirred, sometimes</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">pausing for a second or more before continuing upon its way. Isobel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fancied that the babbling of the machine might be taken for a conversation</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">one could not quite overhear. When she watched it undertaking such</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seemingly purposeful and complex work, the idea that it might be thinking</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">was not so very strange to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Why?&#39; she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Why what?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Why did he make it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Because he could.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;That is no answer. Still, I have a better question, why</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">did he unmake it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex turned as if to answer and then found himself without words,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">staring at her. It was almost as if he could glimpse her thoughts</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">flashing ahead of him like a shoal of silvered fish. Always faster,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">always greater in number than his own. It was as if he was in the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">presence of his master again, racing like the tortoise against the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">hare. But a thought came to him, unlooked for and alive in his mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex recognised that it was one of those ideas he should not think</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">through too deeply, but simply trust. He smiled at the thought of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the surprise those shimmering fish would take as it came crashing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">into their ocean.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Let us ask him.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Who?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Master Whirlaway. The engine is a rendering of his own mind</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in clockwork. Perhaps it is only a crude facsimile, but nonetheless,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">it is he.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And how will you ask him?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;He taught me a language of clocks.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The engine soughed and snuffled gently like a contented horse. The</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">wheel span almost silently. Isobel sensed the weight of it all the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">more now that it was in motion. She suddenly had a terrible vision</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of the thing breaking free from its bearings, crashing across the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">floor of the engine house and through the wall, on across the fields</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and through the villages crushing everything before it and never ceasing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shivered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Wonderful isn&#39;t it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She started and then cursed herself silently. &#39;On the contrary,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think it is quite awful, Mr Stevenson,&#39; she said and took</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">one step to her right in order to remove her shoulder from beneath</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">his chin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh indeed it is, Miss Prentiss, indeed it is. An awful,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">majestic thing.&#39; He drew alongside her again, leaning against</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the railing that surrounded the engine, smoothing the greasy lock</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of hair that was forever wayward across his forehead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps you would like to touch it?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;No, Mr Stevenson, I do not think that I should like that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">at all.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But Miss Prentiss, until you have felt the warmth of an</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">engine, you cannot fathom what a living force there is within. It</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is quite safe. Here, allow me.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He took her by the wrist and drew the grey kid glove from her fingers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She watched in horror, quite unable to think of a response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There is nothing to fear Miss Prentiss, the boiler housing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">is lined with mahogany and cork. What you will sense is just the merest</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">impression of the inferno within.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She allowed him to press her hand to the green painted belly of the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">engine, felt the dull warmth beneath her fingers and, apart from her</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">own revulsion at the proximity of the great engineer, found herself</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">quite unmoved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes, that is remarkable Mr Stevenson,&#39; she said</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and snatched the glove back from him. She turned as if to head for</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the door of the engine house, but Stevenson pirouetted around her,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">coming to rest against the railings again between her and the doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;see how the piston moves? Ceaselessly in and out. It never grows</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">tired. It never gets stuck. The cylinder lubricates it you see? In</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and out.

Alex looked through the doorway at what lay within.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Oh God.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Is it not wonderful, Mr Coldstream?&#39; asked Beatrice,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">throwing her arms around the thing as if hugging it, though Alex saw</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that her arms stretched less than half the way around. Her face was</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">grotesquely stretched in the reflections of its polished surface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He entered the room as if in a trance, unable to tear his eyes from</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">its centrepiece. He walked slowly across the black and white tiles</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">watching his own comically thin reflection in the cylindrical surface.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was a thin man, standing before what he now realised was the fat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">man, l&#39;homme gros, or at least a part of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Of course I have made this one pretty for my palace. The</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ones I have made for London will not be so lovely.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex reached out and touched the thing, feeling it strangely warm</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">beneath his fingertips, with an almost imperceptible sheen of grease</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that made it seem like he was touching skin. He stood before a polished</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">cylinder that was taller than he was and half as much again. Above</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">him the walls of the cylinder tapered to a point in a graceful parabola.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He knew it for what it was, absurd, grotesque, blasphemous and obscene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A shell for the gun not yet fired. The gun called Fat Man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Somewhere in his mind, a thousand questions formed themselves, but</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he could say nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;They tell me that it will travel to the very edge of the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">air itself. Twenty five kilometres high. Can you imagine? When it</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">strikes London it will be travelling at a velocity of six hundred</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">kilometres per hour. Tremblant has calculated that it will not be</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">heard arriving until several seconds after it has struck. Do you think</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that Admiral Collingwood can answer the challenge of my Fat Man, Mr</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Coldstream? We shall play a game of chess, the admiral and I.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And where will your rails take you I wonder Mr Coldstream?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Where?&#39; He turned and fixed her with an odd look.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he laughed, &#39;I had not thought as to where. To the future</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I suppose.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what will we find there at the end of your gleaming</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">rails?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not know.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And yet you bend all your efforts towards getting there</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as quickly as possible.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I wish to know what is there.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What if there is nothing there for any of us? Only steam</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and engines and noise and soot?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;still, I would wish to know.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You are like a moth drawn to a flame Mr Coldstream. You</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">would go there even if it destroyed you?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I would.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But you&#39;ve seen her! Good god, she is quite mad. She would</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">reign over a new Terror. Another generation born into blood and misery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It cannot be. It must not be.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Then they are betrayed.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;How so?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The first wave of the invasion will strike at the navy in</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">its home harbours. The plan depends upon surprise. The fleet will</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">be damaged, if not destroyed, and all the while the army itself is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">safe in transports, not yet set sail from England.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I do not understand.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;They will land on the beaches, and they will occupy the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">towns, but it will be the beaches and towns of England, don&#39;t you</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">see? Once word has come that the navy is defeated, then Bradford can</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">move against Collingwood. He has Marchpane and he has the army. He</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">will force an election and get someone installed as {[prime minister],</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">maybe even Marchpane himself.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Come on!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex let go of her hand and sprinted towards the balloon. Some part</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of him was troubled by this ungallant abandonment, but the rest of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">him knew that she was quite capable of covering the distance on her</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">own, and that he needed all of the time that he could provide for</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">himself to make at least an initial study of the operation of the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">balloon. He reached the basket and stared at the carefully looped</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">lines that draped in great profusion from the iron ring that was suspended</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">above the basket. The basket shook as he felt, rather than saw, Isobel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">vaulting the wicker wall and tumbling into it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Now what?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex looked up again in despair at the ring. There was only one line</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">whose function was obvious and that was the one that swayed taughtly</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">beside him where it secured the basket to the ground. He heard shouts</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and looked towards the palace in the fading light. A dozen or more</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">men were running towards them across the immaculately trimmed lawn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Alex!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He clambered onto the thick sill of wicker, swung the sabre and cut</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the line. The balloon soared upwards, taking Alex so much by surprise</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that he fell overboard. He did not fall very far. He looked upwards</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and saw Isobel holding on to his left arm with both hands. He looked</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">downwards and saw that the ground was already very far away. He dropped</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the sabre and reached upwards towards her with his other hand. In</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">some desperate last access of strength he hauled himself first up</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to, and then over the rim of the basket. Isobel grabbed him by the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">belt and pulled him into the safety of the basket. He lay, face down,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">smelling the warm plant scent of the wicker and listening to it creak</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">around him as it swayed. From somewhere far beneath them he heard</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the crackle of musket fire, but it was so faint that he had no doubt</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that they were already far out of range. He rolled over and looked</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">upwards at the great grey globe of silk that was suspended above them</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as if by some magical force. Their swift ascent brought them suddenly</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">into the last rays of a sun that they had already seen set. The evnvelope</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of the balloon was lit up in a blaze of red and gold. He stood up</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and looked towards Isobel. She was gazing into the distance, towards</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the sunset and her face glowed with life and beauty in the fiery light.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The gentlest of breezes stirred the hair at her brow. Alex had never</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">seen her look more lovely. He staggered to his feet and took her hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She turned to him and said, &#39;You&#39;ve killed us. You bloody</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fool.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## Death By Water</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There had been silence for a long time. The discussion had been brief</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and very much to the point. The relevant arguments and counter arguments</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">had been tabled, leaving little else to be said. Now, Isobel stood</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">staring out towards the far horizon where the sun had finally set</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">for a second time and Alex hung over opposite edge of the basket trying</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to gauge their progress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I believe that we have stopped climbing.&#39; said</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex presently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Isobel said nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex returned to his study of their motion over the far distant ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;The wind is from the south. That is something.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She turned. &#39;And what something is that? That we will drown</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">instead of fall to our deaths?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex found that his patience with her ire had grown suddenly thin,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps we might. At least then you would die content in</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the knowledge that you had been correct, Madam.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;England!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;How far is it do you think?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Five miles. Perhaps more.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;If we continue to descend at this rate we will fall far</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">short.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Then we must lose more weight.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;But there is nothing left to jettison.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Isobel frowned thinly at him and then, in what Alex found to be a</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">remarkably swift action reached behind her back with both hands, unbuttoned</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the top half of her bodice and sloughed off her dress. She stepped</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">out of the pile of grey linen, scooped it up and dropped it over the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is ten pounds if it is an ounce,&#39; she said,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;by my reckoning that should bring us several hundred yards</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">closer to the shore.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex&#39;s mind busied itself with the twin tasks of determining the approximate</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">weight of his own clothing and the somewhat more pressing business</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of knowing where to look. Isobel&#39;s undergarments were not immodest</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">but, he was forced to concede, they were still undergarments and,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">repeated inadvertent sidelong glances confirmed, probably French.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He turned his back to her and removed both of his shoes and threw</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">them overboard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Two pounds. Perhaps seventy yards.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a series of creaks, accompanied by a great deal of huffing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and puffing from Isobel that reminded Alex unaccountably of Admiral</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Turvey. Something white flew past his left ear and spiralled to the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">waves below like a wounded seagull.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;One pound. Thirty yards gained and a good deal more comfortable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Also swimming has now become a possibility for me.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex felt his ears begin to burn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;If I knew that it would bring you safely to the shore I</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">would gladly offer myself as ballast,&#39; he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Mr Coldstream, if it would bring me safely to the shore,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">then I would gladly accept, however we both have mathematicks sufficient</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to realise that unless you are somewhat heavier than a field gun your</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">gesture would be in vain.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex nodded, &#39;Then I am sorry that I have led you to this</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">predicament.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I have never been \emph{led anywhere, Mr Coldstream. I am</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">not a goat. Also, I do not believe that you can be unaware that in</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">most quarters it is considered quite rude to hold a conversation with</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">your back to your interlocutor.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not for the first time Alex felt himself impaled by the twin tines</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of a dilemma of manners. He struggled to resolve the conundrum, feeling</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">his own thoughts thrashing like the wheels of the Whirlaway engine</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">when he had asked it to speculate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You need not fear that you would offend my modesty, Mr Coldstream,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the imminence of death is sufficient to render that a secondary consideration.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex made a great effort of will and turned to face her. She seemed</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">shorter. He realised that she too had discarded her shoes and stood</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">on the wickerwork of the basket in stockinged feet. The prim starched</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">lines of the governess had disappeared, replaced instead with soft</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">folds of rumpled silk and slackened straps and arms that were brazenly</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">bare from wrist to shoulder. She was smiling at him. Alex did not</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">know if he were more amazed by this, or the fact that his mind continued</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">to function normally, his Whirlaway wheels spinning and ticking quite</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Perhaps we should compose some last words appropriate for</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the occasion.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;A sort of epitaph?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Yes. I was thinking of something like &quot;She left the world feeling terribly deflated.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex chuckled feeling suddenly at peace with himself and the world and wondering why with all the radiant loveliness of Isobel before him he felt his eyes drawn so unaccountably to her feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And what would your epitaph be, Mr Coldstream?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There is always the basket itself.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A moment&#39;s scattered confusion and then the flashing shoal of silver</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">fish snapped back into formation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is worth at least another mile. Perhaps two. Do you think you could swim to the shore from a mile or more out?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I know that I could not. But I would die the happier knowing that I had tried,&#39; replied Alex tugging ferociously at the knots on the pair of twisted ropes that bound the basket to the balloon&#39;s iron ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Isobel stepped forward and stayed his hand, &#39;Or better yet.&#39;she said and clambered up onto the creaking wall of the basket, her stockinged feet arched as she balanced, leaning into the basket, supporting her weight with one hand on the ring and tugging at the knots above those that Alex had loosened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Quickly, there is no time to lose!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex understood at once. He knew that the time for thought had come and gone. He pulled himself onto the wall opposite to her and leaned inwards upon the ring, tugging and worryng at the rope with fingers and teeth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;You must secure yourself!&#39; he called as the first knot came undone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;As must you!&#39; she called back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ring dropped downwards suddenly towards Isobel. Alex saw her lose her footing, swaying out precariously over the sea, one hand still on the ring, the other waving in empty space. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His heart stopped. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He watched as she regained her foothold and slipped her arms one at a time through a loop of rope that she had made from the two ends that she had so far freed. He redoubled his efforts and made his own loop, passing it beneath his armpits, and trusting some of his weight to it as he shuffled around the basket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;We must undo the last two together or we shall be thrown!&#39; he called.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She looked up from her work, studied the ring&#39;s rope fastening and then vigorously nodded her assent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He held her to him with a fierce determination that his own shivering</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">should outdo her own as if in some thermodynamickal trickery he could</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">transfer what heat he had left to her, to win her whatever moments</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">more life he could. Her head rocked back and forth with the violence</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of her convulsions and he reached behind her and pulled it to his</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">own as they found a common resonance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Captain Wrathbone!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Mr Coldstream. You seem to make a habit of frequenting these waters, though your taste in companions has certainly improved. By God, I&#39;ll say it has.&#39; Wrathbone&#39;s eye lingered on Isobel longer than Alex felt was altogether necessary to establish this fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;I dare say the admiral would have us establish an aerial</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">blockade against such adventures in the future.&#39; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They made their way silently across the still water, the gentle plashing</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of the oars muffled by the heavy mist. Alex saw them first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Good god!&#39; he whispered &#39;How many?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Fifty ships of the line. &nbsp;One hundred transports. &nbsp;Forty frigates. &nbsp;Sixty-five thousand men.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## The Hanged Man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is wery obliging of you, Mr Coldstream, wery obliging</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">indeed that you don&#39;t cry out. Mr Footfall has such terrible sensitive</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ears and men do get to screaming so,&#39; said Tumbrel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex felt the rope tightening about his throat. His teeth began to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">chatter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Your Mr Whirlaway now, he was one for the screaming, weren&#39;t</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">he Mr Footfall?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Footfall grunted as he secured the rope to the cross beam that supported</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the semaphore arm</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and Mr Tumbrel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;There are no plans. Plans can be stolen. Plans can be copied.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My master built the engine and then he took it to pieces and hid it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He hid instructions on how to assemble the pieces but no design that</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">any man would recognise who did not know what he was looking for.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">## A Handful Of Dust</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex felt it too. A looming presence hanging above them, just beyond the brooding clouds, like a fist ready to strike.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;This cannot be tolerated, Coldstream, it simply cannot. &nbsp;There can be no freedom in England with this threat hanging over us.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;What would you have me do?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ever since Mr Lavoisier was a regular correspondent of the original Lunar Men I am afraid.Earlier even than that. Perhaps as long as men of reason have had cause to look in horror at the crimes committed by those who seek to lead us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But we are not innocent of those crimes. None of us How do you think that you will make a better job of it than Pitt or Liverpool or Collingwood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Because we \emph{are men of reason Alex. Don&#39;t you see? We have fought this war thirty years and for what? Pride and patriotism and pounds of silver. In our world it does not matter that the men who fall on</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the battlefield are French or English or even bloody Prussian. It matters only that they are men of flesh and blood, men with families and hopes and lives to live that are cut short because a fat minister at table in London feels his pride is put upon. That cannot be the way of it Alex, that cannot be the way the world is managed.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex shook his head, &#39;But how? How can you make it work?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stephenson laughed, &#39;Well don&#39;t you see? That is the beauty</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of it. We already \emph{are the men who make it work. Not aristocrats,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">but technocrats. It is we who understand how the machines of iron</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and steam work, how the machines of state function, the machines of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the marketplace. All that remains is for us to disabuse our so-called</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">masters of the notion that they are in charge of anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;And then what?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Then? Then begins a new age of mankind, a glorious era of</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">civilisation and progress - an age of prudence. An age where we can</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">put aside, these bloody, pointless, wasteful, useless wars, put aside</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the division and waste of nation competing against nation. Imagine</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">what we could do Alex, all of us working together towards the same</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">goals of progress and advancement. Imagine what would happen if we</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">could harness the power of our wonderful machnines to this end instead</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of turning them into beasts of war. Imagine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex faltered. He found the vision compelling, so wanted to believe</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">in it that he could think of nothing to say, but in his heart he knew</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">that something was wrong with Stephenson&#39;s dream. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You would harness men like machines, or worse, like cogs in a great</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">engine, an engine of your design. Stephenson, the Great Engineer,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the one mind who knows the direction in which the human machine should</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">pull. You would make yourself God sir, and no man can do that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;It is a great game. A game of chess. Surely a mathematical man such as yourself can appreciate the parallel.&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;People are dying sir!&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Everybody dies, Mr Coldstream, and if the determination</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of when can be made in such a way as to improve the greater good,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">then surely that is to be welcomed, is it not?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Would you become a modern Samson, Mr Coldstream? Pulling</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">the great temple of technology down about our ears?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">{[Poynter and Alex in the Blitz]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Nothing is more important now. We must ...&#39; he</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">stopped and looked upwards. The screaming wind began to rise again,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">sliding unstoppably from the edge of hearing into the deafening whoop.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alex thought of falling angels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What is that sound high in the air</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They made as if to run, but there was nowhere to run to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The shell landed in the next street. A tremendous column of smoke</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and debris leaped up at once and the rushing air tore at his face</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">and clothes and then knocked him to the street where he lay half prone,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">gasping for his lost breath and showered with the pulverised remains</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">of whatever had once been in the street beyond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">This is the way the world ends,</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;murmured Poynter</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">staring up at the ugly black mushroom of smoke and filth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&#39;What?&#39; screamed Alex as soil and cobbles crashed</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">to the ground before them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">This is the way the world ends,</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;he said, almost</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">snarling as he turned towards Alex, </span><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">With a bloody great</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">bang, and a tower of smoke.
