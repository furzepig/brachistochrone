  It was his turn. As he lifted Holly from her bed, screaming and
  thrashing, the hated cot death alarm went off, triggered by the
  sudden cessation of warmth and movement.

  The alarm was more trouble than it was worth - Steph's idea,
  thought Andrew.

  Instead of worrying that Holly might die suddenly in the night,
  they now lay awake waiting for the shrill peeping of the alarm,
  or worrying that it had broken or that the power had failed, or
  that it wasn't sensitive enough and sometimes the thing just
  went off by itself anyway, waking Holly screaming from deep
  sleep and sending them both hurtling into her nursery in the
  madness of nightmare made real.

  'You can't live by those odds. If you lived by those odds,
  you'd walk around all day expecting to get hit by a
  meteorite!' Andrew proclaimed.

  They were the odds of winning the lottery - might as well be
  zero. There was no point in buying a ticket, Andrew said.

  But sometimes he did buy a ticket.

  He changed her in the pale pink glow of the nightlight. Moving
  automatically he was halfway through the sequence before he
  realised that she did not need to be changed, but he carried on
  anyway, a robot soldier too tired and primitive to adapt his
  program. He picked her up and carried her downstairs with cold
  feet, singing and shushing and bouncing as he went.

  The fluorescent tube buzzed for a moment, glowed purple and then
  Andrew's unprepared eyes were stung as the kitchen filled with
  blinding light in a double flash as the tube finally caught.
  Something in his subconscious welcomed the light and the pain,
  as if they were expected - a long awaited release.

  He stumbled to the sink still bouncing Holly in that motion,
  which he was told, was comforting to her but which he thought
  might also have worked by coaxing her towards silence through
  seasickness.

  He pulled the lever of the cold tap towards him and watched for
  a moment, half expecting the water not to come - for there to
  be nothing but the rattle of a dry pipe buried in the walls and
  the rust flecked hiss of stale air. But the water did come, a
  clean stream splashing against the cold bright steel of the
  sink, swirling the little bits of baby rice that were stuck in
  the plughole.

  Holding Holly tightly with one arm, he continued the jogging
  motion and filled the kettle in a clumsy sequence of one handed
  moves: unplug the flex, open the lid, move the kettle under the
  tap, put it back down on the counter, turn the tap off, close
  the lid, plug in the flex, flick the switch. An enumerated list
  of tasks for something that, with both hands free, was fluid and
  unthinking.

  On the crumb-covered worktop was yesterday's post, which he had
  scanned quickly and put aside. Pre-approved credit card
  envelopes - unopened but still there because he would need both
  hands to dispose of them. It was not a matter of simply putting
  them in the bin in these days of identity theft and credit card
  fraud. He would have to tear them to pieces over the bin, or
  take them upstairs to the study and shred them if he wanted to
  do a really thorough job. There were take-away menus and weight
  loss courses, the local free paper and - sitting on top of a
  postcard from Steph's mum in Majorca - there was the leaflet.

  It was white, mostly. Illustrated with colours that were
  not-quite-primary; more like washed out dayglo pastels. The
  font was free of serifs and curlicues as if some working group
  somewhere had decided that the utility of the leaflet would be
  impaired by the flourish of old fashioned characters. He had
  scanned through it quickly while waiting for his toast that
  morning. Interested, annoyed - a little confused at first.
  Hadn't they just sent one a few months back? But this one was
  thicker and more detailed - a practical guide.

  He stood at the counter as the kettle began to bubble, varying
  his up and down motion with a sort of side to side swing,
  turning the pages one at a time.

  He stopped at a page that showed a line drawing in mauve of a
  determined looking man unscrewing a door from its hinges.

  The kettle clicked off. He had not noticed the cloud of steam.
  He was too busy wondering where the screwdrivers were and
  whether the screws in the door hinges in their house were flat
  blade or Phillips.

  Holly sobbed quietly for a few seconds and then howled again as
  he stopped his rhythmic comforting and set about filling a
  glass bowl with water from the kettle.

  He shushed her as he went to the fridge and fetched one of the
  bottles that was filled with the milk that Steph had pumped
  that afternoon. He lowered the bottle into the bowl to warm it
  and went back to the leaflet.

  Andrew turned the page. The man in mauve was now drawn in faded
  lime green as he took his newly liberated door and laid it at
  an angle against a wall with two other doors that had been
  similarly removed.

  'What do you call a door that's gone mad, Holly?' Andrew asked
  hopefully.

  Holly howled in answer.

  'Unhinged,' said Andrew brightly and kept on joggling.

  It was worth a try.

  Written at the top of the page in bold, clear type, without
  curlicue or serif, were words that sounded like they were from
  one of those leaflets that he sometimes picked up at B&Q, 
much
  to Steph's amusement. How To Fit A Loft Hatch. How To Rewire A
  Plug.

  How To Plan a Fallout Room and Inner Refuge

  He bounced back over to the glass bowl, retrieved the bottle,
  shook it and then put it back in the water, before taking Holly
  on a short shushing and bouncing tour of the kitchen.

  Fallout was a word from the world of his grandparents. Like
  lampblack or costermonger or tallow or chokedamp or Bakelite.
  An old word. Forgotten.

  His bouncing passage ended at the counter with the leaflet. He
  scanned the text on the next page, mentally ticking off items
  on the list as he went.

  Yes. Or at any rate there were some batteries in the top drawer
  in the kitchen, but he didn't know if they were the right size
  for the radio.

  No.

  No.

  Two litres of Evian in the fridge.

  He was pretty sure they had some of that in the garage.

  No.

  Yes.

  No.

  Could you get butter in tins?

  He bounced over to the steaming glass bowl, took hold of the
  bottle, shook it again and squirted milk over the back of the
  tired wrist that was still holding tightly on to Holly. The
  temperature was just right. He put the bottle down, hoisted his
  weary and hungry daughter up with both hands, turned her around
  to sit in the crook of his left arm and then presented the
  milk-moistened teat of the bottle for her consideration. She
  took it straight away. Pulling on it with desperate strength,
  gurgling and snuffling.

  'Hungry Holly?' he asked in weary satisfaction as his mind
  once again took notice of the sound of crying that was now
  suddenly absent. He joggled slowly back to the counter and
  turned the page.

  For a moment it seemed to him that the determined man, now in
  radiant duck egg blue, was helping his prone companion into a
  very short sleeping bag that only came up to his knees, but in
  the next panel the determined man was pulling another bag over
  the head of the other.

  'Secure the refuse sacks with duct tape.'

  Holly's clenched fist knocked on the side of the bottle in a
  futile attempt to somehow make the milk come faster. She had
  such tiny fingers but such a strong grip. Miracle fingers.

  'The casualty will be easier to move if the wrists and ankles
  are first tied together with duct tape or shoelaces.'

  He felt something turning inside him. An angry thing appalled at
  these instructions, meant surely for a hit man or a serial
  killer, printed so clearly and with a bright little sidebar
  labelled 'Action Point: Ensure you are familiar with the
  correct procedures for dealing with casualties.'

  'Write the name and date of death on a piece of paper and fix
  it securely. After the fourteen day danger period you should
  take any casualties outside for collection by your local
  authority.'

  Andrew imagined the whistling and shouting of the bin men as
  they marshalled the wheelie bins, showering crisp packets and
  bits of newspaper around the close, picking up those strange,
  long, plastic-wrapped parcels left so neatly by the bins.

  He looked down at Holly. She was entering a contented phase of
  her meal, drawing down the last third of the milk in long
  efficient gulps with only an occasional squeak or gurgle
  belying the imperfect seal between her lips and the bottle.

  Behind his eyelids he saw his own hands take a pale plump arm
  that was wayward with its fist of miracle fingers and tuck it
  beneath black plastic. He heard the sound of tape tearing.

  The postcard from Majorca slid onto the counter as he took the
  whole pile of post over to the bin and dropped it in, feeling
  strange elation at the thought of the pre-approved credit card
  envelopes that would soon be heading back out into the world
  unspoiled.

  'The best defence is preparation,' stared up at him from the
  back of the leaflet, without curlicues or serifs, in unpleasant
  brick red, now spattered with tealeaves and baby rice. The lid
  of the bin dropped shut. He heard Holly pulling on the empty
  air of the bottle and carefully took it from her. She did not
  resist. She was full now - quiet and happy. He put the bottle
  down and carried her upstairs, facing over his shoulder,
  patting and rubbing her back as he did so.

  In the nursery he unplugged the cot death alarm with his free
  hand and then pulled it roughly out from under the mattress by
  its flex. He lifted the lid of Holly's toy trunk and stuffed
  the jumble of wire and cloth and sensors down inside.

  He laid her down in the cot and set the turtle mobile going. It
  played a gentle nursery rhyme with three notes. She lay there
  looking calmly up at the mobile and then up at him. People
  always said that she had beautiful eyes.

  They were wide and brown and there was no fear in them at all.
