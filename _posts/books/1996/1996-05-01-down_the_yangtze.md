The old curmudgeon reaches China.

> You expect this river trip to be an experience of the past - and it is. But it is also a glimpse of the future. In a
hundred years or so, under a cold uncolonized moon, what we call the civilized world will all look like China,
muddy and senile and old-fangled: no trees, no birds, and shortages of fuel and metal and meat; but plenty of
pushcarts, cobblestones, ditch-diggers, and wooden inventions. Nine hundred million farmers splashing through
puddles and the rest of the population growing weak and blind working the crashing looms in black factories.
Forget rocket-ships, super-technology, moving sidewalks and all the rubbishy hope in science fiction. No one
will ever go to Mars and live. A religion has evolved from the belief that we have a future in outer space; but it is a
half-baked religion - it is a little like Mormonism or the Cargo Cult. Our future is this mildly poisoned earth and
its smoky air. We are in for hunger and hard work, the highest stage of poverty - no starvation, but crudeness everywhere, clumsy art, simple language, bad books, brutal laws, plain vegetables, and clothes of one colour. It will be
damp and dull, like this. It will be monochrome and crowded - how could it be different? There will be no star
wars or galactic empires and no more money to waste on the loony nationalism in space programmes. Our grandchildren will probably live in a version of China. On the dark brown banks of the Yangtze the future has already arrived.
