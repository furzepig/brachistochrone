Refreshing challenge to some orthodoxies, especially the interesting mess that cosmology seems to be in. Seems like he had his conclusions mapped out before he began though and quite a few tenuous links and equivalences. Still, very interesting and some good short summaries of where orthodox science is at and what the challenges are.
