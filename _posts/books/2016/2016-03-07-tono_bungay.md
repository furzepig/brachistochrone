The writing seems far superior to War of the Worlds or the Time Machine. Themes seem very modern and relevant to the present, and the ending is impressively downbeat and philosophical.  

'We all make and pass.'  

Love story elements seem drawn out and unnecessary, his familiar themes of 'science as truth' and handing over the organising of society to the men of science are present and perhaps the only part that seems old fashioned.
