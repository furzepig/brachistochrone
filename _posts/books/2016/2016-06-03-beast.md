The evocation of place and the fractured and confused thinking of the narrator were well written.  The Dark Mountain message was there, but handled with  impressive fairness, acknowledging what is - essentially - the Human Condition.  A good short read, but in the end, what was it all about? What was the significance of the Beast, just something that wasn't human? Possibly I missed the point, but it wasn't as good as The Wake.
