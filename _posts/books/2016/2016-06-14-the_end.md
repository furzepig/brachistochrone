Interesting if a little repetitive.  The conclusion  that the system had brought itself to a point where there was no alternative but to fight on, simply no mechanisms to break the deadlock until the death of Hitler.  The last year of the war was truly ruinous for Germany and thought provoking to see the extent to which the Germans considered themselves as true victims of the war by the end.
