Another tremendous survey of the life, times and literary evolution of Shakespeare.  Learned a lot about Julius Caesar, As You Like It and Hamlet as well as the Elizabethan world at the end of the reign of Elizabeth.  Great complement to 1606, definitely want to read more like this, putting the plays in context.
