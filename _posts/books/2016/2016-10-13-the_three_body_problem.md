Very interesting to have a different voice cover some familiar themes.  A few bits that had me worried when it seemed like it might be suddenly a lot simpler and less interesting than it had set itself up to be, but in the end was able to fully redeem itself.  Almost wholly a novel of ideas rather than characters, but the history of the Cultural Revolution and in particular Yeâ€™s story was both critical to the plot and quite moving in an understated way.  Good stuff.
