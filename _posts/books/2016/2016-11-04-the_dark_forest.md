Sometimes felt unevenly paced and stilted but I wonder if a lot of that is an artefact of translation.  Some exhilarating changes of pace and twists and plenty of interesting ideas explored.  Got my own opinions on the Dark Forest theory,  mostly about limits and the end of exponential curves but certainly thought provoking.
