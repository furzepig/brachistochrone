As a vehicle for exploring ideas it was very effective, and kept the energy and changes of direction right to the end.  He was like a droplet crashing through the lined up fleet of ideas, making right angle turns and sudden accelerations. Quite impressive to maintain the Dark Forest concept all the way to its logical conclusion and it resulted in a bleak but impressive view of the universe.  Clever stuff, solid hard sci fi.
