There it is, admiral of the Blue.  This was far more assured than The Hundred Days, a classic scenario of knocking over a foreign fortification without too much danger to self, lots of hot breakfasts, fellows of the Royal Society, coded letters etc.  All good stuff.  So â€¦ what a journey. What did we learn from it? Fix the ship. Persevere. Pace yourself. Exploit luck. Live in the moment. Trust your team.  I will miss them and will save the Unfinished Voyage for some low moment on the future.
