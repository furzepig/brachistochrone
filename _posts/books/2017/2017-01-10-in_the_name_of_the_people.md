Murky and confusing. Interesting that what was such a watershed event in the history of a country is so poorly understood both by historians and the people who lived through the event.  Interesting that such a violent and seemingly unjustified response led to a custodes in support for the ruling party and - apparently - a deep sense of remorse from some of the actors. A bloody mess.  A microcosm of 20th century Africa and - let's face it - the world.
