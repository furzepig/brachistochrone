Still all good fun but I think his plot got away from him a little bit there.  Throwing in the kitchen sink for good measure and leaving some completely unexplained loose ends, presumably as attachment points for a fourth book.  That whole bit in Warsaw seemed… unnecessary, like ‘quick I need another 10000 words’ … however, overall as a trilogy it has been pretty special.  A real sense of place and the uncanny handled so effectively that you don't look too hard for the joins.
