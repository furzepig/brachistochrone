Dreamlike and eerie but another one of those sci-fi novels where the ’secret’ is in plain sight. Why doesn't the protagonist ask more questions? I suppose that's part of the dreamlike nature of it but it throws things out a little. I liked that the physics of the Gradual is basically unexplained and that what the adepts do is essentially magic and that the focus is on the impact of time lost and regained in this way but it's difficult to believe too much in this world where the protagonist seems so incurious.
