Good overview of some of the biggest themes in geopolitics today.  Interesting that my response is mostly ‘ok, so what’.  A world of slightly less liberal but fair and prosperous Singapore type nations seems like a good alternative at present. China as a Pacific hegemon? Again, not necessarily different or worse than the alternative.
