More scholarly and less lucid than the other pieces I have read by him.  Sounds like it was his first serious book and took a long time to bring together.  A little bit too deep into literary/cultural criticism but saved by the last third where he tied the Terra Nova expedition to the experience of the First World War and also the familiarly brilliant penultimate chapter where he imagines Scottâ€™s last days.  This is the Francis Spufford I know.
