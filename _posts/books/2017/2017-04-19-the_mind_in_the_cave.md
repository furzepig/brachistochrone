Very lucid and accessible, but I imagine still reaching conclusions that are probably very controversial in the world of palaeolithic archaeology.  I am slightly sceptical of his 'ropes not chains’ reasoning.  The whole thing seems very plausible and is certainly supported by the available evidence, but … those ropes are very thin.  It could be so many other things too.  Still, probably the best take we have on this to date.
