Much better than I had feared.  I’m very glad I didn’t read it at the time, I don’t think I would have ‘got’ it in the same way.  Now it’s ‘in the past’ the ideas seem somehow clearer, some of them prescient, some of them didn’t pan out but an interesting - in effect - alternate history of the post 9/11 world.  Very funny with people plugging macbooks into dataports all over the place.
