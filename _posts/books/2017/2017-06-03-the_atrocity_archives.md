He does well to keep the more annoying elements of his Twitter persona out of this.  Maybe some ‘first novel’ aspects, a few leaps in context and some not great dialogue - do people really say ‘Say’ outside of a thirties gangster movie - but parts were brilliantly executed.  The scene through the gate could easily have been awful but was actually very tense and evocative.  Will read the rest, but I suspect could get a bit sickly in quantity.
