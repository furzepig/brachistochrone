Slower and a little deeper than Pattern Recognition.  I am starting to appreciate the attention to detail more. These more contemporary books are not full of sweeping hard sci-fi ideas but instead are explorations of our own world but from interesting perspectives.  How relevant does the idea of the Cold Civil War seem this week? Also, it seems weird that people are WAR driving and struggling to get online - a world before mobile data!
