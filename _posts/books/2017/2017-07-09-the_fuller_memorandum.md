Bigger in outlook and more cleanly structured.than the previous ones. Loved the idea of the Concorde flights over the Plain of the Dead. Stuff like that is engaging, some of the set pieces are still a bit overblown and self indulgent (Ride of the Valkyries?) â€¦ but shaping up to be something a bit more meaty than simple fantasy. Having read the suggestion that Bob is not an entirely reliable narrator lends an additional element of interest.
