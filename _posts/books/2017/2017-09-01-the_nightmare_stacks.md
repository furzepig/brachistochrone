Imagine being given the plot of this in direct terms - an army of elves invades Leeds - and making something genuinely exciting and _moving_ out of it without it being stupid or camp or comic book.  Not easy and a very accomplished piece.  The breadth and depth of characters is paying off though it would be good to catch up with Bob again.
