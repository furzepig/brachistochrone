Pulling together lots of threads from the earlier books, developing and extending in surprising and intriguing ways. As well as the intersection of mathematics, computers and Lovecraft I find I'm strangely enthralled by the whole work/management/office dynamic which.  Somehow the Laundry has legitimised the craziness of my own workplace and made me weirdly more engaged at work.
