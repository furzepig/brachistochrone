Restrained, elegiac, distressing, simple but powerful story.  There is scope to read a lot into it but I like that you don't feel you have to.  America was a long time ago and maybe it mattered and maybe it didn't and maybe history matters, but mostly it doesn't.  What matters most is feeding the child, keeping warm finding the ships. Fabulous Dark Mountain type stuff.
