Well-informed sci-fi. So many parallels with Spindrift!  Could have been overly gloomy but actually was quite a tonic.  Almost like an apology for a former enthusiasm for star travel, albeit the Mars books always had this strain of Red, ecocentric politics.  I liked the shipâ€™s voice very much and the ending could have been twee but wasn't.  In the end, not simplistic, not a polemic just some straight up honesty.
