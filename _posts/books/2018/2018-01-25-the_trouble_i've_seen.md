Powerful.  It has that weird 30's Hollywood dialog (presumably they really spoke like that … ) which seems in danger of making everything a bit twee and distant like a black and white movie but instead it's incredibly moving, in the same spirit as _The Jungle_ or _The Ragged Trousered Philanthropist_ but more immediate and more modern. You wouldn't have to change much to turn this into 2018 reportage or a little touch of William Gibson to turn this into near future dystopia.  _Fokkers and Spads_ and the start of _Count Zero_ are unlikely descendants.
