A good survey of some specific locations facing up to sea-level rise.  Very reminiscent of the Kim Stanley Robinson take on this … the usual depressing lack of urgency, coupled with some interesting approaches and a sense that this is becoming ‘real’ for a large number of people who now have to deal in practical ways and is no longer a political or ideological issue, but a real environmental challenge that has to be faced.
