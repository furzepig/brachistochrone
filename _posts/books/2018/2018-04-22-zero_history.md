His 'retrograde motion' has been fascinating.  Despite moving the Blue Ant timeline forward, this is undoubtedly the closest to 'now' he has written.  Weirdly mellow, but still very engaging, we’ve gone from slipping up the gravity well to give birth to new artificially intelligent lifeforms (_Neuromancer_), to deep investigation of the fashion world and introspection in artsy London hotels.  Still … his characters are believable, complex, interesting, mostly likeable and the main charm of reading this is basically spending time with them and living their interesting lives vicariously.  Considered on their own merits, this is a great trilogy.
