Insightful and challenging, possibly a bit too personal and self-centred.   His diagnosis and prescription for poverty would apply to anyone, not just the working class that he is writing about.  Habits, access.to opportunities, taking a level of responsibility for your own actions and responses - interesting about the pressure he has had from the Left due to his more reflective politics.
