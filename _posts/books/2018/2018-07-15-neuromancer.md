Third (or fourth?) time around for this.  It stands up so well, it’s intriguing as to why.  Unlike the first time (aged 11) when the language was dazzling and opaque and confusing, the whole thing now reads like it’s an incredibly lucid and clear exposition.  I suppose that many of the concepts and descriptions are so established now that it takes less of a mental leap.  But the story as a whole works so well - it’s balanced, nuanced, interesting, moving at a sensible if brisk pace.  It’s actually clearer to me now than it ever was about how it could be filmed.  It’s not _Bladerunner_ and rain swept cities, it looks more like _The Wire_ or _Children of Men_.  Again, makes me think about how my relationship with his writing has changed over time - possibly he’s the only author I would describe as having a relationship with in this sense.
