Unexpected.  It approached from some interesting angles and had some new and surprising facts and perspectives.  Perhaps less successful trying to engage with the debate around whether the use of the bomb was justified and how early (and by whom) it had always been seen as a post war weapon.  It's just such a big and complex question, it needs deeper treatment than this.  You can find any narrative you are looking for in there and getting a comprehensive overview is difficult.  The Congo stuff was good, the Fukushima bits somewhat weaker.
