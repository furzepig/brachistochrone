A classic.  The writing is so dense and tricksy though.  Like a really heavy fruit cake … blending into an impressionistic, almost stream of consciousness style at times.  This was written in 1899 and the whole book seems like a manual for the 20th century.  So vivid and prescient.  Interesting that it wasn’t well received or recognise at the time, or even particularly valued by Conrad.  It’s like a warning, an echo of the future that was difficult to interpret at the time but now seems like prophecy.
