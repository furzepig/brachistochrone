Somehow i have avoided Delta Green for a long time.  There is a focus and clarity to these that is compelling.  The modern mythos literature is generally stale and boring.  What's the difference here? I'm not sure, but it's something about the depth of explanation and the human factor. The Delta Green stories are always just a glimpse of something unknown and mind breaking.  It's a hard balance to maintain but it seems to be done very *consistently*. Loved it.
