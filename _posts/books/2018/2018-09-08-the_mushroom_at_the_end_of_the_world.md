An interesting concept to tie so many ideas together with a mushroom.  This could have proved to be a bit of a stretch but felt like it worked pretty well.  Strong ideas of assemblages, ruins and salvage capitalism.  Became a little sociologically dense for me towards the end - or possibly it’s just overlong, the concept valid, but somewhat overstretched.

> The economy is no longer a source of growth or optimism; any of our jobs could disappear with the next economic crisis.

> The dream of alienation inspires landscape modification in which only one stand- alone asset matters; everything else becomes weeds or waste.

> Thus, simplification for alienation produces ruins, spaces of abandonment for asset production.

> What if precarity, indeterminacy, and what we imagine as trivial are the center of the systematicity we seek?

> Precarity is the condition of being vulnerable to others. Unpredictable encounters transform us; we are not in control, even of ourselves. Unable to rely on a stable structure of community, we are thrown into shifting assemblages, which remake us as well as our others. We can’t rely on the status quo; everything is in flux, including our ability to survive.

> Everyone carries a history of contamination; purity is not an option. One value of keeping precarity in mind is that it makes us remember that changing with circumstances is the stuff of survival.

> This book argues that staying alive— for every species— requires livable collaborations. Collaboration means working across difference, which leads to contamination. Without collaborations, we all die.

> Self-contained individuals are not transformed by encounter.

> Precarity is a state of acknowledgment of our vulnerability to others. In order to survive, we need help, and help is always the service of another, with or without intent.

> Scalability is not an ordinary feature of nature. Making projects scalable takes a lot of work. Even after that work, there will still be interactions between scalable and nonscalable project elements.

> Freedom is the negotiation of ghosts on a haunted landscape; it does not exorcise the haunting but works to survive and negotiate it with flair.
