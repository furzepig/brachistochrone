This series continues to fire on all cylinders.  It's impressive how the world moves forward even when favourite characters are sidelined (or killed!)  Certainly the concept of heroes and villains working for rival gods with motivations outside of human imagining could be a tricky one to pull off, but was managed pretty well here. Plenty of hints that there is even more going on and the ground has clearly been laid for this to continue.

> But they’re on the same team now, working to a common shared goal, and a big part of good management is knowing how to work with what you’ve got.

> The less said about the Gadget in the fuselage of 304 Heavy—the one we all hope will never fly—the better.
