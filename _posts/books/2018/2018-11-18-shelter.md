A cosy catastrophe, that turns out to be not quite so cosy after all.  His signature seems to be the rapid change in pace and direction, suddenly disorienting the reader, which is somewhat effective, but can feel a little manipulative.  Overall, the immersion in the post-Sisters world is good, very evocative of a rainy and crumbling England at the end of a nuclear Autumn.
