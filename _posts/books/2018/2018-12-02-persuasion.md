Bright and funny and sharply observed, 
everything people say she is.  Enjoyable 
in it's own right and more than just a 
lightweight comedy of manners, it's still 
a little troubling how shallow a 
perspective of society this gives.  
Outside of the drawing rooms and the 
parties and the concerts, there is 
reference to charitable works and 
landowner's duties but with a 21st 
century perspective something seems 
amiss.  Maybe there was still a sense 
that society still worked as it should, 
that through duty and charity everything 
would continue to work out as it should 
for people in their 'assigned' station of 
life.
