Searigly honest, rivetingly interesting, 
especially about his war experience.  
What a strange, narrow but rich 
experience.  Anyone who is anyone in the 
world of early 20th century letters seems 
to take a turn on the front, pitch up 
back at Oxford and then go quietly mad.  
One of the first first-hand experiences 
of the war I have read that _really_ 
makes you feel like you were there.
