Complex in structure, interweaving multiple stories to create a 'forest' of narrative.  Possibly a little overlong, but it packs in a huge amount of tree facts, personal and cultural history and a strong and clear warning about the degradation of the environment, and forests in particular.

A huge work that really makes you want to go out and hug a tree.
