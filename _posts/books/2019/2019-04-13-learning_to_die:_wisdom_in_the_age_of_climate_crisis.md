> Placental mammals have been around for sixty or
seventy million years - quite a while by huma
dards, but less than two per cent of the life of life itself.
So our kind of bodily structure- the one we share with
mice and elephants - is a fairly new idea. Our genus,
Homo, is also young as genera go: around two and a half
million years old.Our species, Homo sapiens, is less than a
tenth that age. Five hundred million more years of life
would be quite a future by human standards: about 200
times the present age of our genus, and 2500 times the
present age of our youthful and troublesome species. A
lot of good thoughts could be thought in that time, a lot
of sunrises, moonrises, frogsong and birdsong enjoyed,
a lot of good love made, stories told, totem poles carved,

telescopes built, mathematics explored, or - for those
perverse enough to think such things worth while - a
lot of good books written and printed, read and reread.
