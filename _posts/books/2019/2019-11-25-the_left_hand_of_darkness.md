A Culture novel for grown-ups.  So much of this more-or-less directly lifted into the Culture.  The vividness of place is astonishing.

> I thought, shivering, that there are things that outweigh comfort, unless one is an old woman or a cat.

> The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next.

> One is respected and judged only as a human being.  It is an appalling experience.

> It is a society and it has, at least potentially, a culture.

> It is my fault. I have done nothing right.
