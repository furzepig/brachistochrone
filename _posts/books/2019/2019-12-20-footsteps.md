Excellent travelogue and literary discovery.

> It is how every traveller feels at the approach of night, and the lighting up of windows in houses where he does not belong, and cannot enter in.

> But the great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of life a little more nearly; to get down off this feather bed of civilisation, and to find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.

> The light was fading and there was a smell of damp leaves that reminded me of England. The wind stirred and dropped, and everything was still.

> ... livre de poche of Nerval, with marks of coffee-cups on the cover. For the first time—in that pungent half-light, with the rain suddenly beating on the windows—I read the poem of his life, “El Desdichado” (“The Disinherited”), which begins: Je suis le Ténébreux,—le Veuf—L’Inconsolé, Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la Tour abolie: Ma seule Etoile est morte—et mon luth constellé Porte le Soleil noir de la Mélancolie.
