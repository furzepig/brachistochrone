It's no wonder they skate over this in school.  So much intrigue and back and forth across the channel, up and down the country, one county name after another.  Utter chaos.  I think that the scars this sort of thing leaves in the national psyche are probably deeper than we think.  I wonder how many institutions and traditions are built up around the Confucian aim of just trying to get - and _keep_ - things working when you have a lot of nobhead nobles riding around trying to be kingmakers.
