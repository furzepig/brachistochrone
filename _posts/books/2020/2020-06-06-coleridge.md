> My whole being was, with eyes closed to every object of present sense, to crumple myself up in a sunny corner, and read, read, read; fancy myself on Robinson Crusoe’s island, finding a mountain of plumb- cake, and eating a room for myself, and then eating it into the shapes of tables and chairs– hunger and fancy!

> Coleridge’s physical energy exhausted Hucks. He bathed in the sacred pool at Holywell, climbed Penmaenmawr, Snowdon, Plynlimon and Cader Idris; and at Beaumaris “ordered a supper sufficient for ten aldermen”. While tramping, Coleridge fuelled himself with vast supplies of bread, cheese and brandy. He insisted on climbing Penmaenmawr without a guide: they got lost, ran out of water, and were then benighted and thought they were pursued by monsters. Years later Coleridge said the discovery of water under a flat stone on the summit when they “grinned like idiots”, provided an image for the Ancient Mariner.

> He wrote an agonised sonnet beginning, “Thou bleedest, my poor Heart!…”; but added drily: “When a Man is unhappy, he writes damned bad Poetry, I find.”

> “I cannot write without a body of thought– hence my Poetry is crowded and sweats beneath a heavy burthen of Ideas and Imagery! It has seldom Ease…” But this was soon to come.

> He felt that “domestic Sorrows & external disappointments” had depressed him below “writing- point in the thermometer of mind”.

> The Epic could no longer draw on classical or religious mythology for the framework of its action. It must become contemporary with the world of scientific, anthropological, and psychological exploration: it must centre in some way on the drama of self- knowledge, on the growth of consciousness and civilisation.

> (Strange! very strange!) the scritch owl only wak’d Sole voice, sole eye of all that world of beauty!

> he launched into a strange dreamlike evocation of Oriental philosophy. “I should much wish, like the Indian Vishna, to float about along an infinite ocean cradled in the flower of the Lotos, & wake once in a million years for a few minutes– just to know I was going to sleep a million years more.”

> But at night he wrapped himself in his greatcoat and dozed quietly on the deck, watching the shifting movements of the stars, and the glitter of the sea.

> On 26 November he finally caught the all- night coach for London, and his new career. The following day, awaking at dawn, he pulled out his Notebook and made a strange, symbolic entry, describing a flock of starlings glimpsed from his carriage window over the low, wintry landscape. “Starlings in vast flights drove along like smoke, mist, or any thing misty without volition– now a circular area inclined in an Arc– now a Globe– now from complete Orb into an Elipse & Oblong– now a balloon with the car suspended, now a concaved Semicircle– & still it expands & condenses, some moments glimmering & shivering, dim & shadowy, now thickening, deepening, blackening!”

> When Pitt became Prime Minister at the perilously early age of twenty- four, he was entirely unprepared to respond to the moral and intellectual challenge of the French revolutionary movement.

> across which “mists, & Clouds, & Sunshine make endless combinations, as if heaven & Earth were forever talking to each other.”

> It was not exactly a search for oblivion, but through physical effort and danger, to submit himself to the great healing forces of nature.

> He now argues that the poet is a metaphysician who actively engages with nature, who goes out of himself, who hunts down the otherness of being. Coleridge’s revived belief in these powers shines out: It is easy to cloathe Imaginary Beings with our own Thoughts & Feelings; but to send ourselves out of ourselves, to think ourselves in to the Thoughts and Feelings of Beings in circumstances wholly & strangely different from our own: hoc labor, hoc opus: and who has achieved it? Perhaps only Shakespeare. Metaphysics is a word, that you, my dear Sir! are no great Friend to. But yet you will agree, that a great Poet must be, implicitè if not explicitè, a profound Metaphysician. He may not have it in logical coherence, in his Brain & Tongue; but he must have it by Tact: for all sounds, & forms of human nature he must have the ear of a wild Arab listening in the silent Desert – the eye of a North American Indian tracing the footsteps of an Enemy upon the Leaves that strew the Forest; the Touch of a Blind Man feeling the face of a darling Child.

> He had seen, clearly enough, a vision of his own life from that majestic and terrible vantage point: beleaguered by precipices, menaced by thunder, haunted by visions of home, but all the time the quill pen moving companionably over the paper, talking, talking, talking, even in that wilderness.

> In London he put one part of this scheme into immediate operation, by applying to the Equitable Assurance Society for a Life Policy in favour of Mrs Coleridge, which would bring her £1,000 in the event of his death. Hanging, drowning and suicide were not covered.16 The premium was high, £27 per annum, and he had some doubts if his “phiz” would past muster, so he determined to “rouge a little” if necessary.17 The Policy, No. T.20743 was dated 7 April 1803 and granted. He never allowed this premium to lapse for the rest of his life.

> Coleridge entered in his Notebook the possibilities contained in his own biography: “Of a great metaphysician: he looked into his own Soul with a Telescope: what seemed all irregular, he saw & showed to be beautiful Constellations & he added to the Consciousness hidden worlds within worlds.”
