<div class="ll">I had a dream, which was not all a dream.</div>
<div class="ll">The bright sun was extinguish’d, and the stars</div>
<div class="ll">Did wander darkling in the eternal space,</div>
<div class="ll">Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth</div>
<div class="ll">Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;</div>
<div class="ll">Morn came and went—and came, and brought no day,</div>
<div class="ll">And men forgot their passions in the dread</div>
<div class="ll">Of this their desolation; and all hearts</div>
<div class="ll">Were chill’d into a selfish prayer for light:</div>
<div class="ll">And they did live by watchfires—and the thrones,</div>
<div class="ll">The palaces of crowned kings—the huts,</div>
<div class="ll">The habitations of all things which dwell,</div>
<div class="ll">Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum’d,</div>
<div class="ll">And men were gather’d round their blazing homes</div>
<div class="ll">To look once more into each other’s face;</div>
<div class="ll">Happy were those who dwelt within the eye</div>
<div class="ll">Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:</div>
<div class="ll">A fearful hope was all the world contain’d;</div>
<div class="ll">Forests were set on fire — but hour by hour</div>
<div class="ll">They fell and faded — and the crackling trunks</div>
<div class="ll">Extinguish’d with a crash — and all was black.</div>
<div class="ll">The brows of men by the despairing light</div>
<div class="ll">Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits</div>
<div class="ll">The flashes fell upon them; some lay down</div>
<div class="ll">And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest</div>
<div class="ll">Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil’d;</div>
<div class="ll">And others hurried to and fro, and fed</div>
<div class="ll">Their funeral piles with fuel, and look’d up</div>
<div class="ll">With mad disquietude on the dull sky,</div>
<div class="ll">The pall of a past world; and then again</div>
<div class="ll">With curses cast them down upon the dust,</div>
<div class="ll">And gnash’d their teeth and howl’d: the wild birds shriek’d</div>
<div class="ll">And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,</div>
<div class="ll">And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes</div>
<div class="ll">Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl’d</div>
<div class="ll">And twin’d themselves among the multitude,</div>
<div class="ll">Hissing, but stingless — they were slain for food.</div>
<div class="ll">And War, which for a moment was no more,</div>
<div class="ll">Did glut himself again: a meal was bought</div>
<div class="ll">With blood, and each sate sullenly apart</div>
<div class="ll">Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left;</div>
<div class="ll">All earth was but one thought — and that was death</div>
<div class="ll">Immediate and inglorious; and the pang</div>
<div class="ll">Of famine fed upon all entrails — men</div>
<div class="ll">Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;</div>
<div class="ll">The meagre by the meagre were devour’d,</div>
<div class="ll">Even dogs assail’d their masters, all save one,</div>
<div class="ll">And he was faithful to a corse, and kept</div>
<div class="ll">The birds and beasts and famish’d men at bay,</div>
<div class="ll">Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead</div>
<div class="ll">Lur’d their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,</div>
<div class="ll">But with a piteous and perpetual moan,</div>
<div class="ll">And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand</div>
<div class="ll">Which answer’d not with a caress—he died.</div>
<div class="ll">The crowd was famish’d by degrees; but two</div>
<div class="ll">Of an enormous city did survive,</div>
<div class="ll">And they were enemies: they met beside</div>
<div class="ll">The dying embers of an altar-place</div>
<div class="ll">Where had been heap’d a mass of holy things</div>
<div class="ll">For an unholy usage; they rak’d up,</div>
<div class="ll">And shivering scrap’d with their cold skeleton hands</div>
<div class="ll">The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath</div>
<div class="ll">Blew for a little life, and made a flame</div>
<div class="ll">Which was a mockery; then they lifted up</div>
<div class="ll">Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld</div>
<div class="ll">Each other’s aspects—saw, and shriek’d, and died —</div>
<div class="ll">Even of their mutual hideousness they died,</div>
<div class="ll">Unknowing who he was upon whose brow</div>
<div class="ll">Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,</div>
<div class="ll">The populous and the powerful was a lump,</div>
<div class="ll">Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless —</div>
<div class="ll">A lump of death—a chaos of hard clay.</div>
<div class="ll">The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,</div>
<div class="ll">And nothing stirr’d within their silent depths;</div>
<div class="ll">Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,</div>
<div class="ll">And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp’d</div>
<div class="ll">They slept on the abyss without a surge —</div>
<div class="ll">The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,</div>
<div class="ll">The moon, their mistress, had expir’d before;</div>
<div class="ll">The winds were wither’d in the stagnant air,</div>
<div class="ll">And the clouds perish’d; Darkness had no need</div>
<div class="ll">Of aid from them—She was the Universe.</div>
