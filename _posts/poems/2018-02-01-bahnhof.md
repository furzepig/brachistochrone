<div class="ll">Cold steam fills the glazed grey vault, you</div>
<div class="ll">Read the ersatz news of the lost war</div>
<div class="ll">And turn away from that dark shape sliding</div>
<div class="ll">Slowly eastwards between the platforms.</div>
<div class="ll">Surely just a phantom train of thought</div>
<div class="ll">Invisible because it has no windows.</div>
