<p>
<div class="ll">My friend from Asia has powers and magic, he plucks a blue leaf from the young blue-gum</div>
<div class="ll">And gazing upon it, gathering and quieting</div>
<div class="ll">The God in his mind, creates an ocean more real than the ocean, the salt, the actual</div>
<div class="ll">Appalling presence, the power of the waters.</div>
<div class="ll">He believes that nothing is real except as we make it. I humbler have found in my blood</div>
<div class="ll">Bred west of Caucasus a harder mysticism.</div>
<div class="ll">Multitude stands in my mind but I think that the ocean in the bone vault is only</div>
<div class="ll">The bone vault’s ocean: out there is the ocean’s;</div>
</p>
<p>
<div class="ll">The water is the water, the cliff is the rock, come shocks and flashes of reality.&nbsp;The mind</div>
<div class="ll">Passes, the eye closes, the spirit is a passage;</div>
<div class="ll">The beauty of things was born before eyes and sufficient to itself; the heartbreaking beauty</div>
<div class="ll">Will remain when there is no heart to break for it</div>
</p>
