_(after Derek Walcott)_

<div class="ll">Fighter bombers are playing above the Great Salt Lake,</div>
<div class="ll">safe in their own backyard.  Four wheel driven</div>
<div class="ll">megabucket children measure the interstate through</div> 
<div class="ll">endless permutations of franchises.</div>
<div class="ll">The old men's teeth are stones in a Normandy cemetery.</div>
<div class="ll">Their skins as thin as dollar bills.</div>
<div class="ll">Their gaze like desert air.</div>
<div class="ll">Women shop for this culture's consolations</div>
<div class="ll">whilst children get out of their depth.</div>
<div class="ll">and a gun stirs up the jabbering masses.</div>
<div class="ll">Out there in the brilliant stretches</div>
<div class="ll">of desert, green shot glass</div>
<div class="ll">grinds itself to dust against much older rock.</div>
<div class="ll">Once, in summer, in the hidden heart</div>
<div class="ll">of this Empire, golden Trinity</div>
<div class="ll">climbed up through the innocent air.</div>  
<div class="ll">There is no confidence in these conceits.</div>
