(after Derek Walcott)

Fighter bombers are playing above the Great Salt Lake,  
safe in their own backyard.  Four wheel driven  
megabucket children measure the interstate through   
endless permutations of franchises.  
The old men's teeth are stones in a Normandy cemetery.  
Their skins as thin as dollar bills.  
Their gaze like desert air.  
Women shop for this culture's consolations  
whilst children get out of their depth.  
and a gun stirs up the jabbering masses.  
Out there in the brilliant stretches  
of desert, green shot glass  
grinds itself to dust against much older rock.  
Once, in summer, in the hidden heart  
of this Empire, golden Trinity  
climbed up through the innocent air.  
There is no confidence in these conceits.
