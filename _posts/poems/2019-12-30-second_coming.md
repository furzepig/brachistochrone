<div class="ll">Turning and turning in the widening gyre</div> 
<div class="ll">The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</div>
<div class="ll">Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</div>
<div class="ll">Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</div>
<div class="ll">The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere</div>
<div class="ll">The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</div>
<div class="ll">The best lack all conviction, while the worst </div>
<div class="ll">Are full of passionate intensity.</div>
</p>
<p>  
<div class="ll">Surely some revelation is at hand;</div>
<div class="ll">Surely the Second Coming is at hand.</div>
<div class="ll">The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out</div>  
<div class="ll">When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi</div>
<div class="ll">Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert</div> 
<div class="ll">A shape with lion body and the head of a man,</div> 
<div class="ll">A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,</div> 
<div class="ll">Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it</div> 
<div class="ll">Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.</div> 
<div class="ll">The darkness drops again; but now I know</div> 
<div class="ll">That twenty centuries of stony sleep</div>
<div class="ll">Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,</div>   
<div class="ll">And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,</div>   
<div class="ll">Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</div>
</p>
