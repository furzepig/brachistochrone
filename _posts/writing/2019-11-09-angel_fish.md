Stuart was cleaning his teeth. He liked to start at the back on
  the right at the top and work round the whole top row before
  starting on the bottom. He knew that it was important to be
  methodical. As he spat into the sink and looked up again at the
  face of the man in the mirror, he realised that everything was
  the same as it had been on the first day.

  Everything was just the same and everything was different.

  Outside the last stragglers from the mob of hooligan gusts
  banged against the fences and scattered rubbish across the
  street.

  That was the same.

  He rinsed his toothbrush and dropped it back into the mug.

  There were two toothbrushes in the mug now.

  That was different.

  The fish sat in its bottle on the little shelf above the sink
  studying its own reflection carefully in the toothpaste-flecked
  mirror as if looking for the first signs of aging.

  Stuart didn't know how long goldfish lived for, but he knew that
  it was at least a year.
<div class="section">&#x2022;</div>
  He had been brushing his teeth as usual. It was just before
  eight o'clock. He knew what time it was because he could hear
  the weather report on the TV news.

  It was autumn and the weather girl was terribly excited about
  what a stormy night it had been in southern parts and although
  it would brighten up later on there was still a risk of
  occasional showers.

  He was just beginning to brush the big molars at the back on the
  right at the top when he heard a most unusual noise from
  somewhere very close by. It was kind of a resonant wet slap,
  like someone had dropped an overripe peach into a plastic
  bucket.

  He looked round.

  Nothing seemed to have happened in the little bathroom.
  Everything was just where it should be.

  He listened.

  From the direction of his bedroom he could hear the urgent
  drumbeat of the eight o'clock news theme tune. From outside
  there was the hung over surging of the storm-spent wind, but
  otherwise he could hear nothing.

  Then he saw it.

  On the closed beech-effect lid of the toilet seat, surrounded by
  a spray of tiny droplets of water lay a goldfish.

  The goldfish looked at him with a single unblinking eye. Stuart
  though that it must be dead, but then it arched its body,
  raising both tail and head upwards for a full second before
  flopping back down again with an almost inaudible thud.

  He looked around in bewilderment, trying to work out where the
  fish had come from but it seemed almost as if it had been
  somehow teleported into his bathroom.

  His first thought was that the fish had managed to swim up
  through the sewer and out through his toilet, but the lid of
  the toilet was closed, and there had definitely been a sort of
  splat sound as if the fish had fallen onto the toilet from
  above.

  The window was open a little, letting out the steam from his
  shower and letting in the wild blusterings of the stormy
  morning. He supposed that it might just be possible that the
  fish had fallen from the sky and through the window and onto
  his toilet. He had heard that sometimes birds caught fish and
  then dropped them, and on the news site on the internet there
  were always stories about frogs falling from the sky. And giant
  hailstones. And snakes.

  Stuart put down his toothbrush and put the plug into the basin
  of the sink. Then he turned the cold tap on full, went over to
  the toilet and carefully scooped the fish up into his hand.

  He stood looking at it as it lay in his palm. It was about the
  size of his thumb and felt very smooth. It wasn't exactly warm,
  Stuart thought, but there was something not-cold about it and a
  kind of weight that told him what he held in his hand was
  alive. He realised that it had been months since he had touched
  another living thing.

  The scales of the fish shone white and purple and orange and red
  through an oily film. It was every colour \emph{but} gold he thought.
  He had never seen a goldfish at such close quarters before. A
  dark and lidless eye stared up at him expectantly.

  He lowered his hand carefully into the water filled basin. The
  fish floated away from his hand and then swam off, thrashing
  around as it did so as if to shake out the creases in the
  delicate sweep of its fins.

  Stuart turned off the tap and watched it swimming for a while.
  Then he realised that he was late for work.

  He packed his bag quickly. He didn't really need a bag he
  supposed. It was a habit held over from his schooldays. All
  that he usually took to work was his lunch in a Tupperware box.
  It would have been as easy to simply carry the box as it was to
  put it into his faded nylon rucksack. But the Tupperware box
  was see-through and Stuart thought that it was quite important
  to keep his lunch private.

  He had a long and difficult day at work and by the time he got
  home he had forgotten all about the fish. It wasn't until he
  went upstairs to bed after Newsnight that he remembered it. He
  went through to the bathroom and saw it swimming around in the
  sink. It seemed to be quite happy. He knew that he couldn't
  leave it in the sink or he would have had to clean his teeth in
  the bath, or in the kitchen. He went downstairs again to try and
  find a better home for it.

  After rummaging and clattering through his cupboards, Stuart
  decided that he had very few suitable homes for a goldfish. His
  lunchbox was probably the closest thing he had to a fish tank,
  and he needed that for his lunch.

  In the end he found a bottle of mineral water that had quite a
  wide mouth. The bottle was almost empty. He was going to pour
  what was left away but decided that that would have been a
  waste, and that the fish might appreciate a little bit of Swiss
  mountain stream mixed in with the well-groomed, fluoridated
  water from his tap.

  He filled the bottle until it was about two inches from the top
  and then he took it upstairs to the bathroom.

  Catching the fish was difficult. Stuart decided that what he
  really needed was a net, but he didn't have a net, or a sieve
  or anything that was even remotely net-like. In the end he had
  to carefully drain most of the water out of the sink until the
  fish was left stranded in a little pool at the bottom flapping
  hopelessly. Stuart decided that if it could survive being
  teleported onto his toilet then it could probably manage a
  little temporary discomfort while he re-housed it.

  He scooped it up again very carefully. The fish stopped flapping
  and thrashing when he took hold of it. As the water drained away
  through his fingers, the fins of the fish became smoothly
  flattened against its body, turning it into a sleek copper
  ingot. He offered the fish up to the wide mouth of the bottle
  and it slipped easily through it and plopped into the water.
  After a moment of frantic twirling the fish regained its
  balance and began to patrol its new home.

  Stuart put the bottle on his bedside table and got ready for
  bed. After he turned the light off he lay looking at the fish
  in the bottle. Light from the numbers on his radio alarm clock
  shone on the awkward angles of the ribbed bottle and scattered
  through the water. The fish seemed to be hanging motionless in
  space, striped in green light and green shadow. It hardly moved
  at all except for the slow bob-bob-bob of its breathing and the
  occasional deft flick of a fin that held it fixed there.

  `Good night,' whispered Stuart, and then he went to sleep.

  \np He dressed quickly and quietly, listening to the dying 
surges of
  the storm as it staggered up against the house like a drunken
  reveller with a new best friend. He looked at the green numbers
  on his alarm clock in the half dark of the still-curtained
  bedroom. If he hurried he might be back in time to make
  breakfast. He knew that it was important to make the most of
  this time he had before everything changed completely again
  even though he was looking forward to the change more than
  anything.

  He looked at the fish that was looking back at him from where
  the bottle was standing on the chest of drawers next to the
  television. He smiled at it. The fish said `bob'. He pulled on
  a thick sweater and then picked up the bottle. It was cold to
  the touch because it had spent the night in the back porch. He
  had only brought it in so that he could have it in the bathroom
  with him while he cleaned his teeth.

  He left the darkened bedroom and closed the door quietly behind
  him.

 \np  Stuart wasn't really close to anyone. He had seen that 
some
  people seemed to be very close to other people, but in his
  experience and on further reflection he had decided that all of
  that was just for show. He had had a girlfriend for a little
  while, a year or so ago. She had worked in the office next door
  to his and sometimes he would see her in the canteen. One
  lunchtime they had arranged to meet up on a Saturday and go to
  a stately home near to where Stuart lived. He was a member of
  the National Trust and could get in for free. He offered to pay
  for her ticket. He supposed that it was a sort of date. Over the
  next few weeks they went to a few National Trust properties.
  After they had visited the house and grounds Stuart and his
  girlfriend would have tea and cake in the cafeteria and hold
  hands. On the last two occasions they had kissed in the car
  park and then, for a reason that seemed so slight that he could
  no longer properly remember it, they had stopped going out to
  National Trust properties. He almost never saw his girlfriend
  in the cafeteria any more, and when he did she was always
  surrounded by a large group of her friends who sometimes gave
  him strange looks, and always seemed to be laughing at
  something. Stuart thought that sometimes that thing was him.

  At the office where he worked they were all great mates. Stuart
  knew that was the case because everybody was always saying how
  they were all great mates. Stuart had never been invited round
  to the house of anyone that he worked with and he had never
  invited anyone round to his. In fact no one in the office had
  ever invited anyone else in the office anywhere, but they were
  all still great mates.

  Stuart worked in an office where some people sold things and
  some people worked out exactly how much had been sold of what
  kind of thing and how much more they needed to sell. That was
  what Stuart did.

  On the morning after the fish had arrived on his toilet, Stuart
  decided to put the bottle with the fish in it into his bag
  along with his lunchbox and take it to work. When he got to
  work he put the bottle on his desk between his computer and his
  in-tray, but he left his lunchbox in the bag.

  `You want to put that in a bowl, or a tank more like,' said
  Dave Dash who worked at the next desk and who was one of the
  people who sold things.

  `It's all about the surface area of the water see? You need to
  get air into the water.'

  `He likes it in the bottle.'

  `Told you that did he?'

  Stuart didn't reply, but instead went back to working out how
  many things they needed to sell. When Dave Dash went for lunch,
  Stuart took the cap off the bottle.

  \np Normally, he didn't do very much at the weekend -- 
there wasn't
  really very much that needed doing -- but on Saturday he woke up
  feeling quite happy and an idea occurred to him.

  He took the bottle and the fish and drove up to the National
  Trust stately home that was nearest to his house. It had
  extensive grounds and gardens. About fifteen minutes walk away
  from the car park down a long and winding gravel path and on
  the edge of a pretty patch of woodland was a large pond. It was
  man made, but it looked quite natural. In the pond, in the
  summer, you could see large orange fish weaving their way
  between the weeds.

  Stuart sat on a bench by the pond and took out the bottle with
  the fish in it. He put the bottle on the bench beside him and
  smiled. It was good to get out.

  The next week at work seemed to pass by very quickly. The fish
  sat on his desk and said `bob' when people tapped the bottle.

  On the following Saturday, Stuart and the fish went back to sit
  on the bench by the pond.

 \np  He had often thought about getting a new bottle, but 
this one
  was doing fine. He had to give it a thorough clean out every
  week or so, but the fish appeared to enjoy time out in the
  sink. It was still early and so he tried to be very quiet as he
  tiptoed out of the house. He had forgotten about the baby car
  seat that was sitting on the floor of the porch waiting for him
  to fit it and he tripped over it, thumping and clattering as he
  steadied himself against the wall. The fish sloshed around
  woozily in the bottle and Stuart chuckled to himself before
  unfastening the chain on the door and letting himself out into
  the wild freedom of the storm's after-party.

  \np The alarm went off at half past seven just as it did 
every
  morning. Stuart reached out and pushed the snooze button. A
  design limitation of the microcircuit timer inside the clock
  meant that he now had exactly nine more minutes to sleep, just
  like every morning.

  But Stuart did not go back to sleep because this morning he did
  not have to get up. There was no work to go to. He opened his
  eyes and lay looking up at the ceiling for a while and then he
  turned and looked at the fish. The fish looked quite contented.
  It was hanging motionless about two thirds of the way up the
  column of water. When Stuart looked at it, it blew him a kiss.

  In November, the company that he worked for was bought by
  another company. In December, the new company decided that it
  was much too big. It sold another part of itself and then it
  made everybody in Stuart's office redundant.

  He thought about going away for Christmas, but there was nowhere
  to go to. Instead he stayed at home. He watched the television
  and read about goldfish on the internet. He read that it was
  important to keep them in a big tank where the temperature was
  carefully maintained and there was lots of weed and things. But
  Stuart knew that his goldfish liked being in the bottle and
  decided not to get a tank.

  One night, he ran a very cool bath and he didn't put any of the
  blue stuff that turned into foam in it. When he was in the bath
  he carefully lifted the bottle from the floor and into the water
  with him. He turned the bottle on its side and lowered it
  beneath the surface of the water. He gave the bottle a gentle
  squeeze and the fish came swimming out into the bath with him.
  He watched it as it nosed around the edge of the bath and
  explored the strange shape of its new world. They stayed in the
  bath together until Stuart had grown quite cold and he began to
  shiver.

  \np When the New Year came, he stopped setting his alarm 
clock. He
  woke up later and later each morning and went to bed earlier
  and earlier each night. One day it was nearly noon when he
  first opened his eyes. Stuart got up and decided that he would
  go to the stately home where the big pond was.

  It had been a very cold winter. There had been a little snow,
  but mostly the days had been simply cold -- a piercing, grinding
  cold that could not be ignored. When he reached the pond he
  found that it had frozen over. He sat down on the bench and
  looked at the frozen pond. The fish sat in the bottle on the
  bench beside him, just as it usually did. He could see that the
  ice had formed only a thin skin on the water and he knew that he
  would be able to break it easily. He decided that it was good
  that the pond was frozen. It meant that he would become numb
  and that meant that it would all happen much more quickly. He
  stood up and began to scoop handfuls of gravel from the path
  and into his pockets. Rocks would probably have worked better,
  he thought, but there were no rocks by the pond. When his
  pockets were full he kicked over the scoop marks in the gravel.
  He didn't want to make a mess.

  He walked to the edge of the pond and looked across it. Far away
  on the other side the tangled black limbs of a naked wood stood
  against the white sky. It looked like a great scribbling out
  had taken place there, as if some huge mistake had been angrily
  and clumsily obliterated. He heard the crows in the wood calling
  to each other, their cold voices echoing in the still air as
  they carried across the hard flat surface of the pond.

  He took a step forward, and then another. He felt the cold as
  pain in his feet as water spilled over the tops of his shoes.
  Hard edges of ice rubbed at his ankles. He looked down and saw
  where the water he had displaced had slopped up over the
  frosted ice and fouled it with a black slick of rotting leaves
  and pond muck.

  He began to shiver.

  He steeled himself to take another step forward. Then he looked
  back at the fish in the bottle on the bench. It occurred to him
  that if he made it out into the centre of the pond, and if the
  weight of his waterlogged overcoat and the gravel in his
  pockets pulled him under and if the cold of the water stilled
  his arms and his legs and the thoughts in his head -- it
  occurred to him that the fish would die too.

  It would sit in the bottle on the bench until the water in the
  bottle froze, as it surely would. If, on the other hand, he
  brought the fish with him, and set it free into the icy water
  of the pond then he knew that the sudden change in temperature
  would kill it too.

  He had read about that on the internet.

  He stood in the freezing water for a while, looking out at the
  dark wood and watched as his breath condensed and the white sky
  begin to turn grey and yellow as it gathered the weight of
  winter to itself.

  He did not want the fish to die. He turned and walked out of the
  pond and then he picked up the bottle with the fish in it and
  went home.
\np The bottle was on its side and wedged between the dashboard and
  the windscreen with a road atlas. Stuart thought that it was
  important that the fish could see where they were going.

  The roads were quiet and looked scruffy after the storm, strewn
  with leaves and rubbish. Track five of the Classical Moods CD
  began. It was Bach. He had discovered that the fish liked
  classical music and Bach seemed to be its favourite. It gave a
  playful skip and flicked its tail, swimming backwards and
  forwards from one end of the bottle to the other. Stuart
  wondered, as he often did, if the fish recognised the road and
  knew where they were going.

  He hoped so.

\np He hadn't been back to the pond until the spring. It 
seemed like
  a different place entirely. The pond itself was edged with lush
  green plants and was busy with life. Little birds skipped
  across the water catching insects. On the shore opposite to him
  were ducks and dozens of tiny ducklings. Beneath the water he
  could see tadpoles and tiny wriggling things that were the
  beginnings of all sorts of much bigger things. And he could see
  the fish, cruising peacefully between the ragged green columns
  of weed.

  He knew that it was important that he come back to the pond. To
  acknowledge to himself what had happened here.

  Nearly happened.

  He had brought some sandwiches and a flask of coffee. Although
  the sun was very warm, there was still a chill in the air and a
  gusty wind that could make you shiver. On the horizon he could
  see the wood, now lush with foliage that seemed to shimmer
  green and white as the wind moved through its tops.

  Someone sat down at the other end of the bench next to him.
  Stuart glanced quickly at the stranger and slid as far as he
  could across to his own end, drawing the fish with him.

  He felt a little uncomfortable. He had wanted to enjoy his
  sandwiches and the sun on his own -- or at least with just the
  fish for company. He decided perhaps that he would go for a
  walk around the pond and come back later.

  He stole another hurried glance to see if he could discover how
  long the stranger would sit here. He saw that the newcomer was
  a young woman. She had brown hair and was wearing a bright
  coloured jacket of the type people wore when they went walking
  in the mountains. She had opened a bag of crisps and was eating
  them. She looked at him and met his gaze before he could look
  away again.

  `Is that your fish?' she asked.

  He nodded.

  `What's he called?'

  Stuart shrugged. `He's never really needed a name. I mean, he's
  the only fish I've got.'

  She nodded.

  `I had a fish once,' she said. `I'm Andrea. Would you like a
  crisp?'

  Stuart took a crisp from the bag. It was salt and vinegar
  flavoured.

  `What was your fish called?' he asked.

  `Stuart,' she said.

  \np This was the last time this year that he would come to 
the old
  house and the big pond. He didn't want to see it again in
  winter -- to hear the coarse language of the crows and to look
  out at the blank page of the ice. In the spring he would come
  here again with Andrea. Maybe they would come on their
  anniversary. He began to plan it in his head. He would bring a
  flask of coffee and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps and
  they would sit in the sun on the bench and look at the pond and
  talk and laugh.

  He put the bottle and the fish in the big inside pocket of his
  coat. The pocket was supposed to be for maps. His coat was
  quite new. It was brightly coloured and was of the type that
  people wore when they went walking in the mountains.

  He showed his National Trust card to the man in the little
  wooden hut and walked along the gravel path that led to the
  pond. The woodland looked battered and ragged and the trees
  still seethed and hissed in the unsettled air.

  He reached the pond and sat down on the bench. He took the
  bottle out of his pocket and put it down on the bench next to
  him.

  He sat looking at the view for a while, and then he picked up
  the bottle and walked down to the edge of the water. He put his
  hand into the water. It was cold, but not icy cold -- the same
  temperature as the water in the bottle where he had allowed it
  to stand in the unheated back porch overnight.

  He unscrewed the cap from the bottle and then, very slowly and
  very carefully he lowered it beneath the surface of the pond,
  watching as the dark and matter-flecked water of the pond
  spilled over the lip of the bottle and began to mix with the
  clean water inside it.

  He held the bottle on its side and watched the fish as it swam
  backwards and forwards in the swirling water. As the fish nosed
  up to the mouth of the bottle, Stuart squeezed gently and
  watched as the flashing copper body slipped from the bottle and
  into the peaty darkness of the pond. The fish did not pause, or
  turn around. It flicked its tail once, twice, three times with
  a dramatic flourish and then headed down into the darker water
  and the swirling weed.

  Stuart emptied the water out of the bottle and then squashed it
  flat and carefully screwed the cap back on. He stood, looking
  down into the water but could see nothing but the dark weed.
  After a while, he set off along the gravel path that led around
  the pond and back to the car park.

  As he neared the spot where he had seen the family of ducklings
  in the spring he felt something passing over him as if a shadow
  of silence had been cast into the quiet breathing of the day. He
  looked up and saw grey, silent wings unfolding across the water
  and then rearing up as the heron slowed and came to rest on the
  shore of the pond in front of the bench. It strutted out into
  the pond -- fussily lifting its feet far out of the water in its
  purposeful progress. As he watched, the bird stopped and became
  absolutely motionless for what seemed like only a second,
  before it struck at the water -- a blur of grey and white.
  Stuart stood transfixed, unable to think or feel anything.

  From out of the pond, between the two parts of its powerful
  beak, Stuart saw the heron draw something that wriggled and
  twisted -- something that flashed in the low autumn sun. It was
  orange and white.

  And gold.

  The heron stretched out its wings and shook them before rising
  into the air with a single graceful stroke. With one gentle
  beat after another it rose higher and higher and soared
  silently above his head. He turned to watch it as it passed. He
  thought at first that the bird had swallowed the fish whole but
  then he saw that it was still held fast there and that its tail
  was arching and flopping at him as it flew off into the storm
  struck sky.

  Stuart waved goodbye too.
