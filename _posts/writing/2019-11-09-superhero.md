  <span class='firstcharacter'>B</span>y the time we got to Jim and Eileen's house it was all over.
  The Renault Espace on their block-paved driveway was crushed
  like a coke can. The rubber seals from the windows of the
  ruined car had popped out at odd angles like empty speech
  balloons, mute with the horror of it all. Buried in a drift of
  tiny cubes of glass in the flowerbed beneath one of Jim's rose
  bushes I saw the Garfield with suction cups that I had given to
  Eileen when I finally moved out.

  Dev swore. I looked at the grubby Garfield and then at the
  front door that was standing open. Green paint. Stained glass.
  Brass letterbox. Brass Number 6, shiny like it always was.

  6 Rosebury Crescent -- my first proper home.

  And then I was at the door and charging through it, hauling
  myself up the single concrete step with the big white grab
  handle that Jim fitted last summer when Eileen started having
  trouble with her arthritis.

  Dev was yelling at me to stop, saying it was dangerous, They
  could still be in there, wait for the others. And I could hear
  him, but I couldn't think about the words. All I could think
  about was Eileen and Jim.

<br>

  I first met Jim in Tower Records. He bumped into me, deliberately of course, but how was I to know at the time? I was sixteen, frightened at home, fed up at school and sick of reading problem pages that said 'don't feel so alone, you're not the only one' before watching the paper tear itself to
  shreds. I was reading the back of a CD -- a Japanese import of
  'Check Your Head' by the Beastie Boys -- trying to compare the
  track list with the one I had in my head of the non-Japanese
  version. Sad, I know, but in my defence I'll say again, I was
  sixteen and didn't really have anywhere else to be on a
  Thursday afternoon apart from home or school and neither of
  those held a greater appeal than the second floor of Tower
  Records.

  'Sorry son, didn't see you there' said Jim after he
  'accidentally' backed into me. I began to wonder what a
  slightly overweight fifty-something guy wearing beige loafers,
  a Pringle sweater and a duck-egg blue jacket of the kind you
  see for sale in the back of the Sunday supplements was doing in
  the Foreign Imports section of Tower Records and I guess I was
  giving him a pretty hard stare at that point because the next
  thing he said was 'Careful son, you'll crack my glasses!'

  'Sorry,' I mumbled, because that made sense to me and I really
  didn't want to break his glasses. It must have been a full
  second later before I realised exactly what he had said and
  then there I was staring at him again, only this time with big
  round eyes, and my mouth was hanging open too. For years after,
  Jim would still have a good laugh at how long it took for me to
  twig.

  'If the wind changes you'll stick like that,'
  says Jim and turns and walks off towards Easy Listening.

  I must have stood there for ten seconds or more, just gawping.
  It's not an unusual sight in Tower to this day, scruffy looking
  sixteen year olds staring into space, but I bet not many of them
  have the reasons I did.

  'What did you mean?' I said, running after him, still holding
  that Japanese CD.

  'Your face lad. You'll stick like that if the wind changes.'

  'No, about the glasses. What did you mean?'

  And he smiled, like it was nothing.

  'You know what I meant sonny. My name's Jim by the way.'

  And there he was holding out his hand for me to shake and I'm
  stood there again like a Muppet. Bubble burst. Someone has seen
  right through me, weighed me up and moved on like I was nothing.
  I didn't take his hand, not then. I was an ignorant little prick
  at the time. Dev would tell you nothing much has changed, but
  then Dev thinks he's a comedian.

  'How did you know?'

  'I've always been called Jim,' said Jim, with a surprised look
  on his face.

  'How did you know?' I ask again.

  He chuckled and said, 'It's a gift,' and then he looked me in
  the eye, I mean really looked me in the eye and said, 'you
  know.'

  We went for a coffee. This is before the days of Starbucks mind,
  so actually we went for some tea, served in Styrofoam cups in a
  greasy spoon around the corner. All the way there, there's a
  part of me just wants to throw him against the wall and scream
  at him until he tells me everything that's inside his head, but
  I don't, I just wait for him to say what he has to say. That was
  the day my life changed forever. More than that -- it was the day
  my life began.

<br>

The wallpaper is torn off in the hallway -- two neat 
strips about
  a foot wide, torn off at the same height all the way from the
  front door to the kitchen door. I can smell burning. I go into
  the living room. I don't even think about looking round the
  corner first or sensing into the room -- I just go. The first
  thing I see is the coffee table all crushed and covered with
  roof slates. There's water pouring from the edge of a ragged
  hole in the ceiling. The hole's about three feet wide and
  through it I can see into Eileen and Jim's bedroom and there's
  a hole in the ceiling of their bedroom as well and I can see
  through that and through the hole in the roof and into the blue
  sky. The slates that are still hanging around the edge of the
  last hole make the sky look all blocky and square, like its not
  real, like there's been some cosmic error with Photoshop that's
  accidentally pasted a piece of beautiful blue sky onto the
  underside of the roof of this suburban semi. All of the
  electrical equipment in the room has melted down: the black
  plastic case of their fourteen inch TV has oozed down the
  wooden front of the video cabinet that Jim made when I finally
  persuaded them to buy a VCR; the glass bulb of the standard
  lamp has dropped to the carpet in a single hot dollop that has
  burned a neat hole through the wool nylon blend and left a
  glass teardrop embedded in the underlay. I run through into the
  little dining room, which is empty and apparently intact and
  then fling open the door to the kitchen.

<br>

Jim told me that it normally begins around about the time you start to lose your first milk teeth. That made sense to me. I didn't have many toys, but they always seemed to break very quickly -- I had two amputee Action Men and this plastic
  spaceship with both of the wings broken off. Part of me knew
  right from the start, but there was another part that kidded
  myself that toys were badly made and things just broke
  sometimes. One birthday I got a swingball set from one of my
  distant but periodically guilty grandparents. I was out the
  back bashing it around on the first day, trying to see how many
  times I could knock the ball back and forth before I missed it.
  I was concentrating really hard, forty, fifty, then the pole
  just came in two, clattering to the ground. Dad blamed me and
  beat me black and blue. It was like that at my house. But that
  was the day I knew for sure, that was when I started to try and
  understand what Jim called my 'capacity'. Years later in that
  cafM-CM-) I carved up little pieces of Styrofoam into neat squares
  while Jim chuckled, 'You should be on TV with a talent like
  that son.' He didn't mean it -- he wasn't impressed at all -- but
  I could tell he was worried about me and that was a new thing
  and it felt good.

<br>

Eileen was very particular about the kitchen. It was always tidy and spotlessly clean. It was sixties vintage, or early seventies, all pale blue greys and white Formica flecked with black and grey and white tile-effect lino on the floor that Jim was forever having to stick down where it curled up at the corners.

  Now I could barely recognise it.

  All of the wall units and the cabinets had been smashed, as if
  in one blow, and had crashed to the floor in a great heap of
  chipboard panels, spilling teacups and pasta twirls and
  saucepans. The fridge, which was the only new thing in the
  place, was standing just where it normally did, but the top
  part of it was all stoved in, like it had been dropped from a
  tall building. There was water spraying from the severed neck
  of the mixer tap, just going up into the air and falling back
  on itself like some sort of ornamental fountain in the middle
  of all the destruction.

  Jim and Eileen had to be upstairs then.

  As I pass back out into the hall, Dev is coming in through the
  front door and he's still shouting at me, 'Seb, don't be
  fucking stupid!' but I'm up the stairs three at a time,
  noticing how each of the spindles in the balustrade beneath the
  landing rail has a one-inch gap taken out of it. The cuts are
  precise. The white gloss paint reaches all the way to the bare
  wood. There are no chips or flakes like you'd get if they had
  been sliced with a mechanical saw. It's one of Their
  trademarks. If you were to look at the sliced spindles under an
  electron microscope you could see that the cut was clean all the
  way down to the atomic level. A mind bogglingly precise force
  used as a hideously crude weapon.

  I fling open the door to Jim and Eileen's bedroom. The
  floorboards have been flung back from the middle of the room.
  Whatever made the hole was moving upwards at the time. Water is
  still leaking from the ruptured central heating pipes and into
  the living room. There is no one here. I kick in the door to
  the next bedroom and it's just the way I remember it -- my old
  room.

<br>

I lived here for five years. Jim brought me home that first day to meet Eileen. She made a meat and potato pie. Jim rang the Institute, fixed up an appointment with Angela and told me not
  to worry -- it wasn't like a job interview, I couldn't fail it.
  Everyone there would want to help me, and maybe I could help
  them in return. I moved in a week later -- don't think my real
  dad even noticed that I'd gone.

  Angela said I had to finish my GCSEs before I started at the
  Institute full-time. I wasn't too happy about that, but Jim and
  Eileen made sure I went to school every day. I remember getting
  home on the first day to find that Eileen had made my bed. It's
  weird, but more than any of the other things that happened at
  that time, that was the one that I could never get my head
  around.

  Eileen used to fuss after me something rotten. She was always
  trying to feed me up, always had something baking in the oven.
  I don't think I'd ever eaten anything that hadn't come straight
  out of a packet before I moved in with Jim and Eileen. They
  didn't even have a microwave.

  In the summer, after I'd done the exams, I started going to the
  Institute most days. After what seemed like weeks of filling
  out forms and doing medical tests and those psychiatric
  evaluations with the ink blots and word association and all
  sorts of nonsense I finally found myself in a little room
  sitting across a table from Angela.

  'Show me what you can do,' she said and put a house brick down
  on the table top between us. It took a while -- I wasn't used to
  performing on command as it were -- but after a few minutes
  there was a sort of clinking noise and the brick came in two.

  'OK,' said Angela, and that was that. I was rated with
  'borderline kinetic capacity', though they didn't tell me
  that at the time. They were worried that the borderline bit
  would have upset me. And it would. That was when I started to
  work hard for the first time in my life.

  Jim and Eileen redecorated my room not long after I 
moved out --
  there were too many little rips in the wallpaper where I'd used
  blue tack to put up my posters and the wardrobe had more or less
  fallen to bits -- but the walls are still the same colour now and
  the view out of the window is just as it was. Nothing's out of
  place here, everything is perfect and untouched, or it seems so
  until I notice a few wisps of roof insulation and some specks of
  plaster dust sitting next to a neat hole in the floor that's a
  bit less than an inch across. It's perfectly round and there's
  a matching hole in the ceiling. Something angry starts to take
  shape at the heart of my confusion. Who do They think They are
  using stuff like that here in Jim and Eileen's house? It must
  be only about eight seconds since I was looking at that
  Garfield in the flowerbed, but I can actually feel myself aging
  as the seconds tick. I turn away and head for the bathroom and
  hear Dev coming up the stairs after me, screaming something
  about the balustrade, begging me to get out of there.

  \np After I began at the institute full time, I sometimes 
helped Jim
  on his talent scouting expeditions. The first time was when he
  found Dev.

  Dev was eighteen before Jim noticed him sitting outside the
  British Museum one morning. We spent nearly a fortnight tailing
  him to his flat and back to the museum and in and out of all
  those bookies.

  'If he can see through time, then how come he doesn't know
  we're following him?' I asked one day after we lost him
  somewhere on the Circle Line. Jim had a good laugh at that one
  and tried to explain Dev's capacity to me. Frankly, I was more
  interested in his mobile phone. They were still pretty new in
  those days and Dev's was really small. I thought Dev was pretty
  cool. He was two years older than me, dressed in sharp looking
  suits and had a fair bit of cash on account of his unusual good
  luck on the horses. When Jim finally 'bumped' into him in a
  bookies and tried to give him a sure thing tip on the 3.30 at
  Newmarket I felt like a chapter of my life had closed, like I
  really belonged somewhere for the first time in my life.

  \np The panels in the bathroom door are broken, as if they 
have been
  punched out from the inside. I yank the door open and some of it
  comes away in my hand and the rest falls to the floor, exposing
  the full horror of the destruction. It looks like everything
  has been smashed and then burned and then smashed again,

  There's a tangle of branches in the bath and a strange sort of
  greasy film on the tiles and then I look and I see that
  something has actually melted parts of the pink plastic of the
  bath and that some of the branches have gone through it and
  some of them have been bonded into it and then I see that they
  are not branches but bones and I know that they are Eileen's
  bones and Jim's bones, blackened and burned and melted together
  with the pink plastic of the bath and the yellow duck that
  Eileen had kept since she was a child and the non-slip patches
  that Jim stuck on after the time he slipped and knocked his
  hip.

  I can feel Dev trying to pull me up, to take me out of there and
  that's when I realise that I'm kneeling on the floor with the
  black water from the broken radiator and the water from the
  shattered toilet soaking into the knees of my trousers. I can
  feel bits of broken tile and broken sink and broken toilet
  pressing into my kneecaps, but the pain doesn't come. It's
  blocked because my head is full of something that's like anger,
  but it's flowing through me with a force that I can't control
  and I feel like I'm drowning.

  I can't get my breath.

  I'm staring at the floor watching the soot and the grease
  swirling in the water, trying to focus, and Dev's pulling at
  me, trying to get me out of there, and then the floorboards
  start to pop, showering bits of chipboard and spraying water
  and I watch as a fault line zigzags up the floor of the
  bathroom until it reaches the wall and then plaster shears off
  and its only when the first breeze block bursts like a balloon
  and the air is suddenly filled with grey black dust that I
  realise its me doing it and I can't stop. That's when Dev
  knocks me out.

  \np I wake up in the passenger seat of Dev's Z3. It's 
night. The
  world outside is sodium darkness as we flash past a sign that
  says Taunton, which means we're somewhere on the M5. Dev is
  driving fast and speaking into his hands free kit at the same
  time. He sounds tired and angry. After a moment I decide that
  he's talking to Angela but he's not talking about what we saw
  at Jim and Eileen's. I must have been out for a while.

  Something has changed. They have never been quite as inelegant
  as this before. Maybe They're bored, bringing an end to that
  apparent balance we've had since before I was born.

  And why Jim? It doesn't make any sense. Maybe They have a newly
  discovered sense of irony. The thing was that Jim never had any
  capacities. His so-called gift was just that he understood
  people, especially people like us -- could tell what we were all
  about, just by bumping into us in a record store. Eileen didn't
  have anything at all, except that she loved him.

  That day in the cafe Jim told me that I could be a 
superhero. I
  believed him then, but now I don't. Now I know what it really
  means. There's guys I know that have capacities you wouldn't
  believe, but would still run a mile rather than face up to a
  single one of Them.

  Jim and Eileen stood up to be counted with nothing at all,
  except each other -- they were braver than any of us.

  I watch the white lines of the motorway flashing beneath us
  through half-closed eyes. I can't talk to Dev yet -- can't think
  about what happens next.

  All I can think about is that Jim and Eileen died today, and
  they were the only real superheroes we ever had.
