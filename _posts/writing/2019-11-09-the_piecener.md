Once, when very young on Dartford Span at Midsummer, she left
  her sister watching a gaudy Trickster show, and slipped through
  the crowds and the merchant stalls and came to the bridge rail
  and looked down to the wide grey river beneath. There was
  peace in that great height and she felt for a time that she
  looked upon the world as did the Dead—at peace now, despite
  that there were so very many of them crowded above the world of
  the living. And something of that peace stayed with her, even
  after her angry sister pulled her hard away from the rail and
  scolded her back into the stalls of the fair and sulked on all
  the long journey back to the city.

  This year’s Midsummer was long past now, and the child slipping
  from her sister on the Span had turned by the years into a
  young woman, though Pardua remembered well the grey river on
  that bright morning as the early sun came warm to her shoulders
  and she looked down again from a height. The sickness
  eased inside her as she studied the lines of the symbols in
  the grey parking far below. She would not be sick again
  today. She read the numbers between the lines on the far side
  of the parking to pass time as the nausea subsided. Near to the
  building the big white numbers were all covered up with years of
  Moon Gang rubbish thrown from the roof, despite Badney and
  whoever came before Badney and whoever came before him, forever
  telling not to. The old world worked by symbols, Olin said, and
  that was easy to believe because the Dead had put symbols on
  everything. On all the walls and the floors and on every piece
  of loot there were symbols. She smiled as she remembered Olin
  showing her the triangle with stick figures. The symbols on the
  triangle looked like a father and his child walking one behind
  the other. She didn’t know what it meant in the old world but
  she knew what it meant to Olin and loved him for it: Olin with
  his strong hands and the curls in his hair; Olin of the River
  Family; Olin who was forbidden to her without a gang dowry; Olin
  who she loved. He showed her the back of the triangle where
  there were more symbols. Olin told her that they said ‘This
  sign has no scrap value.' She laughed at that. It showed that
  the Dead had not always known everything. Triangles were a
  shilling a dozen at Bishop Stortford market and metal triangles
  were twice that.

  She turned away from the height but the peace stayed with her.
  Went from kneeling, leaning over the parapet, to sitting on the
  rooftop with her back to it. She breathed deeply, enjoying the
  blue of sky and the warmth of the sun on her face and on the
  asphalt—placed a hand on her belly, still flat beneath the
  thick sweater she had traded for wire with the weavers at the
  fair that summer. Flat today and flat tomorrow, but not flat
  for much longer Theresa told her. Theresa who knew, knew before
  she did, only Theresa of all the Moon Gang, wise old Theresa
  older than the city it seemed, as old as the Dead.

'Before the pieceworkers come back from the fields it will be
  plain for all to see that there are two of you.’ And she spoke
  comfort to Pardua but mostly she spoke truth and that made
  Pardua frightened, but she knew after that what it was that she
  must do.

  She stood and walked to the blue butts where the rainwater
  stood, splashed and washed her face, swilled her mouth,
  smoothed her braided hair. Today it was of all the days. Today
  she would tell Badney and the Moon Gang and today Olin would
  tell Gethen and the River Gang and then all would know and fate
  would take them where it would. There was no money between them
  to buy her from the Moon Gang or, and she loved him more for
  even thinking it, to buy Olin from the River Gang. It would be
  for Crookshank to decide their lot. Task them to one gang or
  the other, or banish them from the clan entirely. She did not
  fear her fate now except if Olin were taken from her.

  She looked out across the tumbledown city, raising her hand
  against the great sun that made the wild wasting look somehow
  clean and new. Away to the west she saw smoke fingers pointing
  to the cooking fires at the hospital, the clan house where
  Crookshank entertained the gang leaders at breakfast now, as
  every morning, showing who was boss and doling out shopping
  lists and territories.

  In her mind she asked the Dead to make Crookshank move the River
  Gang’s territory on. All days since the full moon they had been
  working in the White Tower, the tower that had been worked and
  left husked who knew how many years ago. Left for a reason was
  what Olin said to her, each day thinking it worse and worse,
  spending his time making warding signs and shoring up walls and
  staircases where the concrete blistered and split.

  `It’s bad in there. There’s a parking underneath, full of
  tacsis all burned and banged and the walls are all black and
  broken.‘

  Badney told the Moon Gang never to go into a building where you
  could see the wires in the walls. Not the weavable rope wires
  or the brightly coloured braiding wires but the fat wire --
  thicker than fingers -- that held everything together, the
  rusted wire that poked from the top of the fallen buildings,
  that only the Dead of the old world had known how to bend as
  they would. But Gethen made the River Gang go to the White
  Tower where the wet wires glistened in the crumbling walls like
  bones, because Crookshank told him to and Crookshank paid him
  to.

  In the evening, on the day before the day before this one they
  had lain on the still-warm asphalt of the book building looking
  into the blue-black sky and Olin told her what he knew.

  `Crookshank wants boxes of tricks. It’s the only thing left in
  the White Tower, but there’s lots of them.’

  She would have laughed -- it seemed so funny. But it was not
  funny because the White Tower was dangerous and in her mind --
  in the night -- the Dead came to her and whispered of a life
  without Olin, a life alone and she was afraid.

  Boxes of tricks were toys for children. They were full of the
  greenboard which you could cut and polish up to make beads for
  necklaces and little bits of coloured wire and lots of other
  things that were good for braiding into your hair or making
  broaches. The box itself was strong and made of metal, but not
  all that useful because it had holes in and no lid to open.
  They were worth something, but surely not worth going into the
  White Tower for, when there were whole streets of towers and
  arcades that no gang had been inside since the Chaos between
  the Dyings and probably not even then.

  `Somebody wants them. As many as we can find, Gethen is
  getting two pounds a score so who knows what Crookshank is
  taking.‘

  She had held tightly to him then, on the cooling roof of the
  book house, because she could and because she thought that if
  she could only keep hold of him he need not go back into the
  White Tower again.

  `Hoy, hoy, Moon Gang look lively!’ Badney’s voice echoing up
  the metal stairs brought her into the now and she dropped fast
  down the stairs and into the gang hall.

  Moon Gang forming up in the wide open space of the gang hall,
  facing the big wall where the first Moon Gangers had drawn a
  map of the city and the river and all of the territories and
  the areas that had burned and burned again, using those fat
  steelos that could write on anything and would never come off --
  the map ever since then, updated with the buildings worked and
  the buildings closed and the territory lines changed, drawn a
  hundred or a thousand times since the clean wall was first
  marked.

  `Not Burned and Once Burned today boys and girls so make the
  most of it!‘ said Badney, pleased with himself and fat on
  Crookshank’s breakfast.

  `Railtown and all points west to the triple road.’

  Good territory, lots of loot and easy work to get it. Badney not
  pleased with the quiet response from the sleepy Moon Gang bangs
  his great chest and bawls from his fat beard, `Who looks after
  you hey? Gethen’s taking the River Gang back into Parkside
  today!‘ Jeering and cheering, Parkside filled in all black on
  the map because it is Once Burned, Twice Burned,
  Who-knows-how-many-times Burned and standing in the middle of
  it, the White Tower.

  `Make hay while the sun shines ladies and gentlemen, Mr
  Crookshank wants steelos as always, wire, glass, hand tools, no
  more light bubbles for the time, paper if its wrapped,
  especially big paper,’ he shows the length of the big paper
  just to make sure they know, `all skellys to be reported back
  to me and also any boxes of tricks.‘ Laughter, then not
  laughter.

  `Boxes of tricks. Report to me,’ says Badney as quietly as he
  ever says anything, great dark eyes scanning the room, all the
  gang assembled there but the pieceners standing to the front,
  both young enough and old enough to go out into the crazy maze
  of the old city and pick it apart piece by tiny piece making
  new life from the old death.

  `Alright!‘ bawls Badney after the silence, `Be careful out
  there.’

  So they go -- arranging themselves into the teams that work the
  best. Pardua finds Rula, who is still sleepy in the morning.
  Rula is not the greatest piecener in the city but she is good
  company and works safely. They tumble down the long stairs
  hefting their bags and their belts and their tools and some
  with gloves and some with hats, whooping and cat-calling in the
  echoing stairwell for they are young and have a purpose and the
  sun is shining. Josten one flight up on the twisting stairs has
  his eye on Pardua, as all summer and calls down to her, leering.
  Pardua laughing, for she knows she is strong and young, the best
  piecener in the gang and that she loves only Olin who is a dozen
  of whatever Josten is and more, the one-fingered warding sign is
  all that is needed to silence him and they spill then from the
  gang house laughing and eager for the day.

  And it is a good day. Rula and Pardua working the long arcade,
  clamber through crawl spaces and under a fallen roof of glazing
  to force shutters with a crowing bar, then cut the hasp of a
  lock long rusted and find a room untouched by the Chaos, just
  as it must have been on the first day of the Great Dying -- full
  of things that are clean and square in a way that only the Dead
  knew how: all kinds of paper, heavy and different colours; and
  tubes and pots of colours like bright messengers from the old
  world; and steelos and pencils in flat tins and little boxes;
  and the sticky paper tape; and colours in cans that mist in the
  air and symbols everywhere and signs. It is too much to carry
  and so Rula leaves the store place and calls for Lamb who is
  their runner -- too-young-for-piecener but learning. He comes
  quickly and with an eager face -- Pardua and Rula can’t help but
  laugh -- Lamb’s head is shorn close because of fleas and his ears
  stick out. He scowls but then they show him the store place and
  he is excited and runs to fetch Badney and retrievers -- the
  too-old-for-pieceners who are still young enough to fetch and
  carry. Pardua takes a fat black steelo and draws the Moon Gang
  sign and then her sign and then Rula’s sign on the door of the
  store place. Their find, their loot -- their share is one
  shilling in three of what Crookshank pays.

  As the sun passes its height they climb to the roof of the low
  arcade with heavy bags of loot, hungry and happy and sit
  dangling hobnails above the symbol scarred street calling down
  to those of the Moon Gang more luckless than they and jeering
  at a harassed ratrunner as he scampers through their patch with
  a message for one of the other city clans and eating the fat
  pies that only Theresa knows how to make and enjoying the sun.

  She sees it happen long before she hears it.

  Sees the end of it before she hears the start.

  Gazing out across the city tops she sees the White Tower, and
  watches as it falls into itself and dust rises like smoke from
  a smothered bonfire. And she drops the pie to the street and
  stands to see better as the far off rumble comes to her, long
  and low, telling of the end of the white tower.

  She knows then. Knows before the River Gang runners come seeking
  help, before the clan rats have the news, before the noise has
  finished rolling all across the great banged and burned and
  beautiful city, she knows that he is dead.

\np Later when she stands, and the Moon Gang stands and the 
River
  Gang stands and all of the gangs of the whole clan stand
  watching the registrer of the dead making warding signs over
  the smoking rubble heap -- watching because they cannot dig to
  find the lost, because they have only their hands and cannot
  use the sleeping machines of the Dead -- then, she finds herself
  thinking of the night on the warm roof of the book house when
  they looked for satters, when it was still summer and the sky
  only just grown dark. And she knows now that that was the
  night, of all the nights when they lay there together. She
  could always see them first, before Olin did. He told her how,
  long ago, the Dead had made some of the stars move so that they
  could always tell where they were. And she asked him how that
  could be and he didn’t know and told her that maybe the only
  people that knew that sort of thing now were the Oxford
  scholars, and then they planned a life together and fell to
  dreaming.

  And later still when they had come away at last and 
the tears
  ended for a time and the rest of the gang slept curled together
  like a wounded dog pack and dreaming troubled dreams, she
  climbed to the roof of the book house again, feeling his hands
  curl around hers once more and she lay down and wondered at the
  mysterious satter light that once guided the Dead on earth and
  hoped that Olin looked down from a height beyond the satters
  and had found a peace there. Then she lay still for a long
  time, until in her mind she heard the Dead telling her that
  life was more, always more, than death and that no amount of
  deaths or Dyings would ever take life away from the good earth.

  And she felt something stirring inside her and she placed his
  hand on her belly so that he could feel it too.
