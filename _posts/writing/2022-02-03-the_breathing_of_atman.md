The Breathing Of Atman (or A Brief History Of Jeremy Morgan)}

\subsection*{Dimension 0 -- The Big Bang}

  No time passes, for there is no time there. The seething
  elements of the Infrastructure -- the unknown and unknowable
  membranes that support the eleven dimensions of our bubble
  universe -- swirl on in their own mysterious shifting of
  potentials until at last, and immediately, separating membranes
  spin yet another bubble universe into being.

\subsection*{Dimension 1 -- The Cosmic Background}
V
  The cosmic ray, discharged from the heart of a quasar ten
  billion years ago, strikes the atmosphere high above
  Shrewsbury, unleashing a shower of neutrinos which take no more
  notice of the thick air than if they were coasting in the hard
  vacuum, all that is save one -- which passes first through the
  fuselage of a B17 bomber on a training mission over Wales in
  this, the month before D-Day -- and then through the slate roof
  of the little house where Mr Rhodri Morgan and his wife
  Angharad have just conceived their first child -- Jeremy. The
  neutrino strikes the nuclear heart of a hydrogen atom inside
  the yet-to-be-implanted zygote -- spawning an electron and
  interfering with the transcription of a single codon during
  Jeremy's first cellular fission.

  This event -- the single most improbable physical interaction
  that has ever taken place on the face of the earth -- goes
  unnoticed.

\subsection*{Dimension 2 -- Inflation}

  In the days before ultrasound screening, Angharad's doctor is
  concerned by the unusual size of the head of the unborn child,
  which he can feel through the pale skin of her belly. He
  confides in Mr Rhodri Morgan that he fears the baby will be
  hydrocephalic. Mr Rhodri Morgan spends the remaining three
  months of his wife's pregnancy preparing for the worst.

  In the event Mrs Morgan has a successful four-hour labour. Mr
  Morgan is relieved to discover that Jeremy is not hydrocephalic
  -- he simply has a large head.

\subsection*{Dimension 3 -- The Standard Model}

  `On my first day at grammar school, I was taken ill on the
  bus. Too well brought up to make a mess, I was sick into my new
  school cap.'

\subsection*{Dimension 4 -- Event Horizon}

  He walks through the courtyard in the cool October air and
  tosses the college scarf over his shoulder again. He still
  finds it hard to believe that he is really here. He has worked
  so hard in the last few months, finally achieving the required
  exam grades but only just, he fails to get in to his first and
  second choice colleges but is cleared at last by the pool
  system and comes up to Cambridge in the second week of October.

  His first tutorial is terrifying. Until this time he has always
  found himself to be the brightest person in the room. Now he is
  eclipsed by not one, but half a dozen others. The tutorial has
  barely begun before he is certain that he can see the spectrum
  of colours in the room change as the conversation moves away
  from him so quickly that it red shifts like a receding galaxy.
  His tutor and two of the brighter students finish by discussing
  something called a muon that he has never even heard of. But the
  new challenge excites him. He practically runs from that first
  tutorial to the library, determined to be better prepared the
  next time.

\subsection*{Dimension 5 -- Singularity}

  Her name is Sarah. It is February and the wind from the fens is
  cold. He has been running to stand still, spends most of his
  waking hours in the library but now at last he feels he is
  making progress. She is studying Oriental languages. Her
  textbooks fascinate him. They have page after page of Mandarin
  characters. It reminds him of opening his first mathematics
  books; there is so much impenetrable information and no obvious
  place to begin trying to understand it all.

  They spend a lot of time together in the library, and then a
  little more outside it. One night he drinks five pints of
  Greene King and when he walks her back to her college he
  summons up enough courage to kiss her. She kisses him back. He
  feels like a Spectral Type K2 red hyper giant sun heading for
  supernova.

  Later that night he carves their initials into the bark of an
  oak tree. As he stumbles homewards along the college backs his
  thoughts begin to spin inwards, drawn by an idea that attracts
  them like a grand singularity; like rogue planets trapped
  within the Schwarzchild radius of a black hole. There is an
  alignment. Something in the frozen air from the fens, the
  balance of alcohol and oxytocin in his blood stream and the
  physical structure of his brain -- minutely altered by the long
  ago collision with a neutrino -- locks together and all at once
  he sees it -- the single grand truth uniting relativity and the
  standard model, cosmology and religion. The mathematics that
  describes it comes flashing into his brain in all its
  staggering beauty.

  He sees. For the first time he truly sees how it all works, each
  exchange particle and decay product slotting into place in the
  vast fabric of reality. He spreads out his arms and looks
  upwards into the blazing stars whooping for the joy of it all,
  again and again. It is all so clear to him now. He spins
  around; dizzying himself, falls to the neatly mowed grassy
  slope beside the Cam, panting with exhilaration and promptly
  passes out.

  In the morning he can remember nothing of his revelation.

\subsection*{Dimension 6 -- Twistor}

  `I just don't think we should see each other any more Jeremy.'

\subsection*{Dimension 7 -- Dark Matter}

  `And what about Morgan?'

  `Yes. I think we can put him down as a star that failed to
  reach critical mass. He works hard enough, but never really
  seems to shine.'

  `Not suitable for post-graduate work then?'

  `No. Not at all.'

\subsection*{Dimension 8 -- The Many Worlds Interpretation}

  LONDON (AP) -- Jeremy Morgan, Nobel laureate and author, died on
  Tuesday 33 Octember at his home in Cambridge. Morgan won a
  Nobel Prize for his cosmological theory uniting General
  Relativity and the quantum Standard Model. He popularised his
  work in the best-selling `A Short History Of Space and Time'.

  LONDON (Reuters) -- One man was killed and two others badly
  injured in a car crash in Cambridge on Tuesday. The dead man
  was named as Mr Jeremy Morgan, 63, an accountant from Reading.

  LONDON (AP) -- Traffic in the centre of London was held up for
  several hours on Tuesday afternoon when a cameleopard escaped
  from the vehicle that was transporting it to the Regent's Park
  zoo.

\subsection*{Dimension 9 -- Entropy}

  Long, long, afterwards the peaceful and continuously expanding
  universe is torn asunder by the unstoppable extra-dimensional
  march of the membranes.

  In the collapse, energy spills from the rendered universe,
  reenergizing and redirecting the ineffable membranes. The
  spread of energy from the bursting bubble is almost perfectly
  uniform and comes close to self-annihilation but is saved from
  that fate by the infinitesimal imbalance that has been caused
  by a tiny mass defect at the heart of a long dead star, where
  several billion atoms of carbon are missing that once were part
  of the bark of an oak tree.

\subsection*{Dimension 10 -- Omega}

  No time passes, for there is no time there. The seething
  elements of the Infrastructure -- the unknown and unknowable
  membranes that support the eleven dimensions of our bubble
  universe -- swirl on in their own mysterious shifting of
  potentials until at last, and immediately, separating membranes
  spin yet another bubble universe into being.
