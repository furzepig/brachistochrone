  Mrs Fraser's mid-afternoon meditation is interrupted. In her
  sitting room, behind white voiles she sits watching Lorna, just
  as she does every day. This afternoon the caption on the screen
  reads 'My boyfriend cheated on me with his wife and I want
  payback.' She has been engrossed, finds herself confused by the
  rights and wrongs of the case until Lorna sets her straight with
  a skilful balance of shouting and not letting her guests speak,
  'It's all about who you love innit?' Lorna asks the audience
  who applaud enthusiastically, 'INNIT?' she screams at the
  cuckolding boyfriend-husband-lover who, Mrs Fraser can now see,
  deserves everything he gets. But there has been an interruption
  and now here it is again - a knock at the door.

  She is gripped by a sudden fear. No one calls in the afternoon.
  No one calls in the morning either, but in the morning there is
  the possibility that the postman has brought a package for her,
  though the postman never brings a package.

  She gets to her feet and heads for the door, her mind racing
  with dangerous possibilities. On 'Have A Happy Morning With Tom
  and Trudy' she has seen what happens to people like her who just
  answer the door, people who trust other people to be who they
  say they are. There is a procedure to follow and even that may
  not keep you safe she knows. The chain is already fitted on the
  door, but she rattles it so that whoever is on the other side
  can hear it. She opens the door a fraction and peers through.
  There is a man standing on her doorstep.

  'Here to read your gas meter love,' he says.

  A slim hand slides in through the gap holding an identity card.
  The hand is olive coloured. Mrs Fraser is surprised, she had
  thought the man was local because of his accent, but now a
  dozen new fears rise up. She studies the identity card; the man
  in the photo is smiling at her. He has dark hair and dark skin.
  The card says 'Electricite de France'. She doesn't understand.
  Why would a French company be reading her gas meter? Perhaps he
  is one of those Alky Eda terrorists? On the six o'clock news she
  learns that terrorists could be living in every community in
  Britain. On the nine o'clock news a man on from the government
  tries to say that terrorists aren't living in every community
  in Britain. But it is too late by then; everybody knows the
  truth of it.

  She is paralysed with a dread sense of foreboding. What can she
  do? She knows that if she doesn't let him in he will force the
  door chain just like she saw happen in last weekend's omnibus
  edition of Slatterdale Street. She takes the chain off and
  opens the door hoping to avoid angering him by putting up a
  futile defence.

  She feels his huge physical presence as he bundles into the
  hallway, bringing cold air from the street with him. He is tall
  and heavy and his overalls and jacket make him look even bigger.
  He carries a toolbox in one hand and a big black satchel over
  one shoulder. She realises how foolish she has been. Why would
  a meter reader need two bags?

  'Where's the meter then, under the stairs?' he asks. She nods
  and points at the stair cupboard. Before she knows what has
  happened he has opened the cupboard and half disappeared into
  it with a torch and she finds herself looking at the soles of
  his work boots. They are very large and have a deep tread. She
  knows that they probably have a steel toe as well, just like
  the boots that were an important lead on last Tuesday's edition
  of Crimebeat. When the police found those boots they were
  spattered with blood. He withdraws from his lair beneath the
  stairs, 'Look at that!' he says beckoning her into the dark
  space, 'It's a Mark 4 compression meter. You don't see many of
  those these days.'

  She hangs back and does not bend to look where he indicates. She
  knows what this is all about, in 'A Passion For Death' on the
  Real Movies Channel, the psychopath mechanic asked the pretty
  girl to help him check the oil level. As she bent under the
  bonnet he hit her over the head with a monkey wrench.

  'Just got to dial this in,' says the man. 'Have you got a
  spare power socket somewhere?' she is confused, but points to
  the kitchen, desperately trying to buy herself time. She
  doesn't like to think what he needs a power socket for.

  In the kitchen he pulls a laptop computer from the black satchel
  and puts it on the work surface. He plugs it in, opens the lid
  and begins to type. She doesn't know much about computers, but
  what she does know has led her to believe that they are bad. 
  In addition to all of the viruses they
  cause, computers can get into your bank account and be used to
  lure children from the safety of their homes into the dark rain
  swept streets of the dramatic reconstruction. She feels sickened
  by terror.

  'When did you last get your boiler checked? Mind if I have a
  quick look at it while I'm here, we've got this proactive
  maintenance scheme for senior citizens. It's a new thing
  they're starting up. Doesn't cost you anything.'

  He hands her a leaflet. Blurred by terror her eyes cannot read
  what it says. 'Upstairs is it?' he asks. She nods dumbly.
  'Don't suppose you could pop the kettle on could you love?
  I haven't stopped since breakfast.' She nods again.

  She knows what will happen now. He will go upstairs and rifle
  through her jewellery, find the shoebox with her pension money
  in it and her father's medal. On 'Britain's Best Burglars' she
  learned that it takes only thirty seconds for a professional
  burglar to locate all of the valuable items in a pensioner's
  bedroom. When he has finished stealing from her he will come
  back down here and finish her off. That much is clear to her.
  She imagines how her story will be reported on 'Crimeday GB'
  and hopes that someone will be able to provide Stuart at the
  Crimeday desk with a good photo of her. The old women that are
  beaten to death on Crimeday normally have very grainy
  photographs that make them look vague, not like real people at
  all, she thinks.

  Another thought occurs to her. Instead of a grainy photo on
  Crimeday GB, perhaps she could be in colour video on Region
  Tonight with Tony Johnson -- the brave granny who fought off her
  attacker, coming up after the weather. She doesn't have any
  children, or grandchildren, but she knows that to Tony Johnson,
  she will still be a brave granny. She feels her fear turn into
  resolve. She will not be a nameless statistic; she will go down
  fighting.

  Her eyes alight on the little row of medicine boxes that stand
  by the tea caddy. She is under the doctor for several
  conditions. She does not like her own doctor. She thinks that
  he is a miserable man who does not listen to her problems. She
  much prefers to watch Dr Raj on Mid Morning Health Check even
  though Dr Raj is Indian and, she suspects, one of _them_. In the
  blue box on the counter is a medicine that has been prescribed
  for her heart. She knows that it is a powerful drug because Dr
  Raj says so. A few months ago Dr Raj advised his viewers to
  check with their GP if they were worried by the scare that was
  created by certain irresponsible newspapers after he, Dr Raj,
  ran a story that suggested that in certain rare circumstances,
  the pink and blue pill that Mrs Fraser takes every day could
  kill. When asked, her own doctor gives her short shrift, as
  usual. 'As long as you don't take more than the amount
  prescribed you'll be fine,' he insists wearily and says
  something not very complementary about Dr Raj.

  She sets about making the tea as the idea comes together in her
  head. She allows herself to hope that she might survive this
  ordeal. She hears her assailant thumping about upstairs. It
  sounds to her like he is in her bedroom, going through her
  underwear, tipping out each drawer as he comes to it, from
  sheer evil glee as much as greed. As she pours water from the
  kettle into the mug with the kittens on it she sees that her
  hands are shaking with fear.

  Whatever happens next, she knows that he will drink the tea.
  People like him always take the time to finish their drinks. In
  'Dangerous Desires' on the Classic Movies channel, the
  gold-digging and murderous blonde who had married the widower
  of the woman she killed before tricking him into changing his
  will, stabbed him in the back and then stood drinking champagne
  as her husband pleaded for help. That had made quite an
  impression on Mrs Fraser.

  She works as quickly as her trembling hands allow. Pulls the
  pink and blue capsules apart with her knitting needle thin
  fingers and dumps the contents straight into the swirling tea.
  The powder inside is made of white grains that are very regular
  in size and very round in shape. She hopes that they will
  dissolve properly. She is about to start on the sixth capsule
  when she hears the toilet flushing upstairs and then the
  bathroom door opening. She sweeps the foil and plastic pill
  packaging into the cutlery draw. Crazed with fear she looks at
  the knives in the drawer there and considers taking a weapon to
  defend herself, but she knows that she is too weak and the
  knives are too blunt.

  'All done. No problems. I'll make a note of it and then we
  won't have to come back for twelve months.'

  He goes to the computer and begins to type. She feels her heart
  pounding in her ears. What is he doing now? She imagines that
  somehow she is being broadcast onto the Internet, like she has
  seen on 'Lunchtime Today with Rick and Sue'. Rick and Sue tell
  her that it is a sick world and that people will pay to see
  anything. She knows that somewhere on the other side of the
  world a South Korean businessman in a seedy hotel is even now
  keying in his credit card number, hoping to see a British
  pensioner battered to death in her own kitchen.

  'Ooh, is that my tea?'

  She nods. He drinks.

  'You can't beat a nice cup of tea!' he enthuses.

  She nods again and clutches at the kitchen counter to stop her
  hands from trembling so much. He drains the cup in a second
  draught and puts it down on the melamine work surface. He
  closes the lid of the computer and puts it in its case, then
  shuffles the little sheaf of papers and hands her the top page.
  It is pink. She watches it flapping as her hands shake.

  'There you go love, that's your copy, it's just to say that I
  checked the boiler and it was OK.'

  What new trick is this? He is playing with her, fooling her,
  making her feel safe so that she is defenceless when he
  strikes.

  'Right then I'm off!' he says and heads back down the hallway.
  At the door he stoops to tie his laces. This is it she thinks.
  It is now. When he stands up he will be holding a knife or a
  gun and that will be the end of it - or worse, the start.

  He begins to stand up. She feels the terror taking control of
  her. How can she stand this any more? At any second she feels
  that she must scream, or pass out.

  As he stands, he loses his balance and steadies himself against
  the white wood panelling of the staircase. He puts his hand to
  his head and turns to look at her. His face looks grey, 'Must
  have stood up too fast,' he says with a confused smile,
  unnerved by his own weakness, 'Cheerio then.' The door opens
  and then he is gone, the door slams behind him and locks itself
  shut.

  She collapses to the floor sobbing. She is safe. But is she
  really safe? In 'Inverted Obsession' everyone thought the
  killer had gone, but then he came in through the patio doors
  that had been left open. Mrs Fraser has no patio doors but
  still she fears his return.

  She hears Lorna's voice from the sitting room. Lorna has a guest
  who is an expert on something or other.

  'Just how scared should we be?' asks Lorna.

  Mrs Fraser weeps and listens hard for the answer because she
  does not know anymore.
